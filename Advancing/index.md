# Advancing
New talents are gained by accumulating experience (XP). XP is gained by spending the gold pieces (GP) found on adventures. New talents require 2000 Ã— your current number of talents in XP.

Each time that you gain a new talent, you increase an attribute by one and add your Constitution score to your stamina total.
