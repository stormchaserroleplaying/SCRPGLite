# Injuries
Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. However, if a player wishes to take no stamina damage from a given attack, then they may instead check for a lingering injury.

To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the injury table of the corresponding damage type. These tables assume a typical humanoid physiology, but the results can be adapted for creatures with different body types.

If you roll a 1-3 and have no more body parts of the given type to lose, or if you roll a 4-13 and have already suffered this injury, then you suffer the next worst injury on the table. If you cannot sustain any further injuries, you are dying. 

Resistance to the damage type causing the injury grants advantage on the roll. Vulnerability to the damage type causing the injury imparts disadvantage on the roll. If the roll falls within the range defined by the coverage of your armour, then you may reroll and take the better result.

Fresh injuries are at risk of festering. The first time that you take a long rest after suffering an injury, make a DC 11 Constitution defence check. If your injuries have been cleaned with a successful DC 13 Medicine check, then you have +1d on this check. If you fail, then you suffer a festering wound in addition to your injury.

> **Festering Wound:** Your stamina maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your stamina maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals

Sometimes, a character suffers from an injury that requires a period of natural healing to be removed, such as an internal injury. Days on which a character suffering from such an effect receives magical healing while at maximum stamina, count as two days for the purposes of determining the duration of such injuries.

## Siege Injury
This table applies only to impaling, crushing and explosive damage from a siege weapon that dealt more than half your maximum stamina in damage and reduce you to 0 stamina. Make a simple d20 roll. Roll with advantage if the damage is impaling. Roll with disadvantage if the damage is explosive.

If the siege weapon damage deals damage of more than half your maximum stamina, but doesn't reduce you to 0 stamina, you instead roll on the physical table.
