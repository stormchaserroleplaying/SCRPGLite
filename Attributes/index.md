# Attributes
Start by generating your character's attributes.

Much of what your character does in the game depends on their six attributes: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** and **Charisma**. Each attribute has a score, which is a number that you record on your character sheet.

* **Strength** measures athleticism and bodily power.
* **Dexterity** measures agility, reflexes, balance and poise.
* **Constitution** measures health, stamina and vital force.
* **Intelligence** measures acuity, recall and analytical skill.
* **Wisdom** measures awareness, intuition and insight.
* **Charisma** measures confidence and eloquence.

You generate your character's six ability scores randomly. Roll 4d6 and record the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. Alternatively, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character's six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.

After assigning your attributes, determine your attribute modifiers using the table below. To determine an attribute modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the attribute and then divide the result by 2 (round down).

| Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:--------:|
| 3     | -4 |
| 4-5   | -3 |
| 6–7   | −2 |
| 8–9   | −1 |
| 10–11 | +0 |
| 12–13 | +1 |
| 14–15 | +2 |
| 16–17 | +3 |
| 18    | +4 |

## Stamina
You start your career with an amount of Stamina equal to your Constitution score.
