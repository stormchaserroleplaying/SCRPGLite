# Defences
Your defences represent your ability to resist spells, traps, poison, disease and similar threats to avoid taking damage and overcome attacks to the body and mind. If an opponent's attack roll equals or exceeds your defence score, the attack hits.

You have six defence scores and each class gives proficiency in two defences. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence defence. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a defence lets a character add their proficiency bonus to the defence score derived from a particular ability score. Some monsters have defence proficiencies as well.

If a defence check is called for, make an ability check using the named attribute. If you are proficient in the defence, you may also roll your proficiency die.

If a defence check is made to avoid being hit by an attack that would have had advantage, the defence check is made with disadvantage. This counts as the attack having advantage for the purposes of triggering abilities such as a Rogue's sneak attack. If a defence check is made to avoid being hit by an attack that would have had disadvantage, the defence check is made with advantage.

## Strength Defence
**Strength Defence: 10 + Strength modifier**

A character's Strength defence represents their physical power. How well can they oppose a force that would physically move or bind them?

When defending in melee you can choose to use your Strength defence to block an attack, rather than evading it. You take -1d to your Strength defence vs melee attacks that deal bludgeoning damage and +1d to your Strength defence vs melee attacks that deal slashing damage.

> ### Blocking With An Item
> A weapon or shield can be pushed beyond its limits, damaging it in the process. When you make a Strength defence check to block an attack, you may choose to brace your weapon or shield against the threat. The item takes the damage that the attack would deal to you (see [Interacting With Objects](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/InteractingWithObjects/)) and you benefit from advantage on the Strength defence check.

## Dexterity Defence
**Dexterity defence: 10 + Dexterity modifier**

A character's Dexterity defence represents their physical finesse. How well can they dodge out of harm's way?

In combat, most attacks target a creature's Dexterity Defence. You take +1d to your Dexterity defence vs melee attacks that deal bludgeoning damage and -1d to your Dexterity defence vs melee attacks that deal slashing damage.

## Constitution Defence
**Constitution defence: 10 + Constituion modifier**

A character's Constitution defence represents their physical resistance. How well can they endure a disease, poison, or other hazard that saps vitality?

## Intelligence Defence
**Intelligence defence: 10 + Intelligence modifier**

A character's Intelligence defence represents their mental finesse. How well can they disbelieve certain illusions and refute mental assaults with logic, sharp memory, or both?

## Wisdom Defence
**Wisdom defence: 10 + Wisdom modifier**

A character's Wisdom defence represents their mental resistance. How well can they resist effects that charm, frighten, or otherwise assault their willpower.

## Charisma Defence
**Charisma defence: 10 + Charisma modifier**

A character's Charisma defence represents their mental power. How well can they withstand effects, such as possession, that would subsume their personality or hurl them to another plane of existence?
