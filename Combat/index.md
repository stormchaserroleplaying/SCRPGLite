# Combat

## Initiative
Roll 1d20 + your Dexterity bonus. This determines what order combatants go in.

## Dodge
Your dodge score is equal to 10 + your Dexterity bonus. This determines how hard you are to hit.

## Attack
Roll 1d20 + your bonus. If it’s equal to or greater than the monster’s dodge, the attack hits. Casting any spell counts as an attack.
* Melee attacks use your Strength bonus, ranged attacks use your Dexterity bonus. Magic attacks use a mental attribute bonus defined by your talents.
* In addition to their attack, **dragonkin** and **warlocks** can also use their breath or blast.
* A **dragonkin warlock** can’t use both blast and breath.
* Wielding a **small** and **medium** weapon gives you one extra attack

## Damage
1. Roll the weapon or spell’s damage (DMG).
2. Subtract the target's damage reduction (DR) from the damage.
3. Subtract the result from the target’s stamina.
4. At zero stamina, the target is dead.

## Positioning
You can get where you need be from round to round. For longer distances, assume you can move about 60 feet without making an attack, or 30 feet while making an attack. You can move before and after an attack.

## Rounds
A round is about 6 seconds. Everyone acts at about the same time.

## Recovery
Stamina represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live and luck. Recover your max stamina after 8 hours of rest, or half your max HP after 4 hours or rest. Elves still need to rest to heal.
