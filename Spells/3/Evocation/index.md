# Evocation

## Fireball
*3rd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 150 feet (20-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A piece of bat guano and sulfur.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A roaring blast of fire appears at a point within range that you designate. Make an evocation attack roll vs the Dexterity defence of each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. On a hit, a target takes 6d6 fire damage, or half as much on a miss.

The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d6 for each additional point of mana.

## Gather Forth All the World's Waves
*3rd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

Lift your hands and sing to all the seas you cannot sea. A 30 foot radius of space around you is filled with churning, crashing waves of white-crested green water. Creatures in the water begin [suffocating](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Adventuring/TheEnvironment/Suffocating/) and thus cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components, unless under an effect that allows them to breath in water.

Make an evocation attack roll vs the Strength defence of each creature in the area of the spell. On a hit, they take 3d8 bludgeoning damage and are picked up and deposited prone at a location of the spellcaster's choice within the area of the spell. On a miss, the creature takes half as much damage and remains unmoved. After 1 round, the waves dissipate, returning to their distant homes.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, the damage increases by 1d8 for each additional mana.

## Sending
*3rd level Evocation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Unlimited<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A short piece of fine copper wire.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognises you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.

## Spreading of the Repelling Minerals
*3rd level Evocation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self (30-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Small bits of minerals.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You scatter minerals strange and esoteric as a part of this spell's casting. A 30-foot cube magical zone is created originating from you. All metal objects not held or worn are thrown out of it with haste, as are objects made of stone or bone. 

Make an evocation atack vs the Strength defence of any creature within the area holding or wearing any such object. On a hit, any such held object is pulled out of their hands, landing in a space of your choice immediately outside of the area. Additionally, any creature wearing any such object is pushed 10 feet in a direction of your choice. On a miss, this spell has no effect on a creature.
