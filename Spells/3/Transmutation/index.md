# Transmutation

## Blink
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on the Ethereal plane). You gain Resistance I to all damage, except force. You can [Sustain the Spell](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/CastingaSpell/Duration/#sustain-a-spell) to vanish and reappear 10 feet away in a random direction determined by the GM; the movement doesn't trigger Attacks of Opporunity. At the end of your turn, you vanish and reappear as above. 

You can dismiss this spell as an action.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the ability to do so.

## Inflamed Feet
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute
 
Billowing flames grant you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 10 feet and moving doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. When you move within 5 feet of a creature or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, it takes 1d6 fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or more mana, your speed increases by 5 feet and the spell deals an additional 1d6 fire damage for each additional mana.

## Plant Growth
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions or 8 Hours<br>
**Range:** 150 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause the plants within the area to be healthier and more fruitful. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 2 actions, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land, increasing the crop yield for farms, in addition to the other benefits of healthy plants. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year, doubling the crop yield in the area.

If you cast it in the area of a [*Blight*](), plant growth attempts to counteract the [*Blight*](), instead of producing its usual effect.

## Speak with Plants
*3rd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 10 Minutes

You imbue plants and fungi within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather and other circumstances. Cunning plant or fungus monsters are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane comments.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant life (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plant life is present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration. For example, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s discretion. This spell does not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant or fungi creature is in the area, then you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language. However, you gain no magical ability to influence it. This spell does not make plants and fungi more friendly or intelligent than normal. Most normal plants and fungi have a distinctive view of the world around them, so they don't recognise details about creatures or know anything about the world beyond their immediate vicinity.

This spell can cause the plants created by the [Entangle](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Conjuration/#entangle) spell to release a [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) creature.
