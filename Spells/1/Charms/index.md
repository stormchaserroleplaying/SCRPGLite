*1st Level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

*You shout a command that's hard to ignore.*

You speak a one-word command to a creature in range. Make a charm attack vs the Charisma defence of the creature. On a hit, the creature follows the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the creature is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the creature behaves. If the creature can't follow your command, the spell ends.

**Approach.** The creature moves towards you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

**Drop.** The creature drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

**Flee.** The creature spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

**Grovel.** The creature falls prone and then ends its turn.

**Halt.** The creature doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, you can target one additional creature for each point of mana above the 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Compelled Duel
*1st Level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** 30 Feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 1 minute

*You attempt you coerce another, making it difficult for them to attack anyone but you.*

Make a charm attack vs the Charisma defence of one creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your demand. For the duration, it has -1d on attack rolls vs creatures other than you, and must make a Charisma defence check vs your charms spell skill each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this check, this spell doesnâ€™t restrict the creature's movement for that turn.

The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

## Heroism
*1st Level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

*You instill a friend with bravery.*

You touch a willing creature and, until the spell ends, the creature is immune to being [Frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) and gains temporary Stamina equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each of its turns. When the spell ends, the creature loses any remaining temporary Stamina from this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, you can target one additional creature for each point of mana above the 1st.

**Range:** 90 Feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A petrified eye of newt.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 hour

*You place a curse on a creature that makes your attacks more impactful.*

Target one creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with an melee or ranged attack; damage type is determined by choice of patron. Also, choose one attribute when you cast the spell. The target has -1d on skill checks made with the chosen attribute.

If the target drops to 0 Stamina before this spell ends, you can use an action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature.

A [Remove Curse]() cast on the target ends this spell early.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or 4 mana, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use 5 or more mana, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.

## Hideous Laughter

**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

*Your words or actions - funny or not - are perceived to be so hilarious that it causes some to fall to the ground in fits of laughter.*

Make a charm attack vs the Wisdom defence of one creature within range that you can see. On a hit, the creature falls [Prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/), becoming [Incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.

At the end of each of its turns the creature can make a Wisdom defence check vs your charms spell skill. Additionally, the creature can make a Wisdom defence check vs your charms spell skill at the beginning of its turn if it has taken damage since the end of its last turn; the creature has +1d on the check if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

## Sleep
*1st Level Charm*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 90 Feet (20-foot radius)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A pinch of fine sand, rose petals or a cricket)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

*You send creatures into a magical slumber.*

Roll 10d10; the total is the amount of Stamina that this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current Stamina (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current Stamina, each creature affected by this spell falls [Unconscious](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Unconscious) until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creatureâ€™s current Stamina from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest Stamina. A creatureâ€™s Stamina must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being [Charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) arenâ€™t affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 2 or more mana, roll an additional 4d10 for each point of mana above the 1st.
