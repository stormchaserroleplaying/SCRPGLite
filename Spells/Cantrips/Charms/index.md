# Charms

## Encode Thoughts
*Charms Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** S<br>
**Duration:** Up to 8 hours

*Your thoughts, or possibly those of others, are made tangible.*

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as detect thoughts or modify memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting detect thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)

## Friends
*Charms Cantrip*<br>
*Casting Time:* 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** S, M *(A small amount of makeup applied to the face as this spell is cast.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you have +1d on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile towards you. When the spell ends, the creature realises that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the GM's discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.

## Mind Sliver
*Charms Cantrip*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 60 Feet<br>
**Components:** V<br>
**Duration:** 1 Round

*You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of a creature.*

Make a charm attack vs the Wisdom defence of one creature that you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier psychic damage and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of your next turn has +1d.
