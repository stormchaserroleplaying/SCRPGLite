*You hurl a bubble of acid.*

Choose one or two targets that you can see within range. If you choose two, then they must be within 5 feet of each other. Make a conjuration attack roll vs the target's Dexterity defence. On a hit, a target takes 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier corrosive damage.

Until the spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube on ground that you can see.

You can use 2 actions to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
