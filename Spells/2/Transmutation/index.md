# Transmutation

## Alter Self
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.

**Aquatic Adaptation.** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

**Change Appearance.** You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same. For example, if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use an action to change your appearance in this way again.

**Natural Weapons.** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. When you make an unarmed strike with these natural weapons, make a melee transmutation attack. On a hit, you deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon that you chose. Finally, the natural weapon is magical and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you that make using it.

## Barkskin
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A handful of oak bark.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target's skin has a rough, bark-like appearance and they gain DR 8 and coverage 1-2, 8-16. The effects of this spell do not stack with worn armour.

## Disfiguring Touch
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 3 Days

Make a transmutation attack vs a creature's Wisdom defence. On a hit, the creature becomes cursed for the duration of the spell. The victim of this spell grows hideously disfigured. The physical appearance of the deformity is subject to the caster’s whim (most demon worshipers choose deformities that reflect their Abyssal patron’s shape or form).

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, then the spell's duration increases by 2 days for each additional mana.

## Dusk that Settles On Mud
*2nd level Transmutation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch (10-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(The dust of a black ore.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Sprinkle the dust of a black ore onto clay, mud, soil, brick, limestone, or any other earthen substance. It will turn into constricting, hard, black metal and shrink in size. Up to a 10-foot cube of earth can be enchanted in this way. At the beginning of your next turn, it will have shrunken down to the size of a pebble.

## Earthen Grasp
*2nd level Transmutation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet (5-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A miniature hand sculpted in clay.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature that you can see within 5 feet of it. Make a transmutation attack vs the Strength defence of the creature. On hit, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) for the spell’s duration.

Using 2 actions you can cause the hand to crush the [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) target. Make a transmutation attack vs the Strength defence of the creature. On a hit, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a miss.

To break out, the [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) target can use 2 actions to make a Strength defence check vs your transmutation skill. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [restrained](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Restrained/) target if you do either.

## Enhance Ability
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Fur or a feather from a beast.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

*Bear's Endurance.* The target gains +1d on Constitution checks. It also gains +1dR temporary stamina, which are lost when the spell ends.

*Bull's Strength.* The target gains +1d on Strength checks and their carrying capacity doubles.

*Cat's Grace.* The target gains +1d on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/).

*Eagle's Splendor.* The target gains +1d on Charisma checks.

*Fox's Cunning.* The target gains +1d on Intelligence checks.

*Owl's Wisdom.* The target gains +1d on Wisdom checks.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, you can target one additional creature for each additional point of mana spent.

## Enlarge/Reduce
*2nd level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 ft<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A pinch of powdered iron.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, make a transmutation attack vs the Constitution defence of the target. On a miss, the spell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

**Enlarge.** The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has +1d on Strength checks, indirect attacks vs its Strength defence suffer -1d, and its walking speed increases by 5 feet. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size and deal 1d4 extra damage.

**Reduce.** The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category. Until the spell ends, the target also has -1d on Strength checks, indirect attacks vs its Strength defence gain +1d, and its walking speed decreases by 5 feet. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size and deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

## Haste
*2nd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A shaving of licorice root.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Magic empowers the target to act faster. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled and it gains +1d to Dexterity defence.

When the spell ends, the target can't move and suffers -1d to Dexterity defence until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using 3 mana or more, then the target also gains +1d to melee and ranged attacks. If you cast this spell using 4 mana or more, then the target gains an additional action on each of its turns.

## Magic Weapon
*2nd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 hour

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 4 or mana, the bonus increases to +2. When you cast this spell using 6 or mana, the bonus increases to +3.

## Paper Wings
*2nd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A sheet of paper.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature while begging them to fly halfway around the world. The target gains a flying speed of 30 feet for the duration. This spell ends early if the target takes fire or radiant damage. When the spell ends, the target comes spiraling down, landing in a random location within a horizontal radius equal to their altitude when the spell ended.

## Slow
*2nd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 120 feet (40-foot cube)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A drop of molasses.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Make a transmutation attack vs the Strength defence of each target. On a hit, an affected target's speed is halved, it takes −1d to Dexterity defence.

A creature affected by this spell makes a Strength defence check vs your transmutation skill at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends for it.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using 3 mana or more, then the target also suffers -1d to melee and ranged attacks. If you cast this spell using 4 mana or more, then the target has one less action available to it on each of its turns.

## Spider Climb
*2nd Level Transmutation*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A drop of bitumen and a spider's leg.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 10 minutes

*Tiny clinging hairs sprout across the creature's hands and feet, offering purchase on nearly any surface.*

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climb speed equal to its walking speed.

## Spike Growth
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 150 feet (20-foot radius sphere)<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(Seven sharp thorns.)*<br>
**Duration:** Sustained, up to 10 minutes

Any ground-covering vegetation in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Typically, spike growth can be cast in any outdoor setting except open water, ice, heavy snow, sandy desert, or bare stone.

The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration and any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.

When a creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed at a Dexterity defence check vs your transmutation DC or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the injured creature receives a [Heal](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Restoration/#heal) spell (which also restores lost Stamina). Another character can remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and succeeding on a Medicine check vs. your transmutation save DC.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Perception check vs your transmutation skill to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

## Water Breathing
*2nd Level Transmutation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** 30 feet<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(A short reed or piece of straw)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

This spell grants up to 7 willing creatures that you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using 3 mana, then the spell's duration increases to 8 hours. If you cast this spell using 4 mana, then the spell's duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast this spell using 9 or more mana, then the spell lasts until it is dispelled.

## Wood Shape
*2nd level Transmutation (Ritual)*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(One piece of wood no larger than 25 cu. ft.)*<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You form one existing piece of wood into any shape that suits your purpose. While it is possible to make crude coffers, doors, and so forth, fine detail isn’t possible. There is a 30% chance that any shape that includes moving parts simply doesn't work.
