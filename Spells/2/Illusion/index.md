# Illusion

## Invisibility
*2nd Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Touch<br>
**Components:** V, S, M *(An eyelash encased in gum arabic.)*<br>
**Duration:** 1 Hour

Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes [invisible](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Invisible/) until the spell ends. This makes it undetected to all creatures, though the creatures can attempt to find the target, making it hidden to them instead. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that hostile action is completed. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using 3 or more mana, you can target one additional creature for each additional point of mana.

## Mirror Image
*2nd Level Illusion*<br>
**Casting Time:** 2 Actions<br>
**Range:** Self<br>
**Components:** V, S<br>
**Duration:** 1 Minute

Three illusory images of you swirl about your space, potentially causing those who attack you to hit one of the images instead of you. Any attack that would hit you has a random chance of hitting one of your images instead of you. If all three images remain, there is a 1 in 4 chance of hitting you (1 on 1d4). With two images remaining, there is a 1 in 3 chance of hitting you (1–2 on 1d6). With only one image, the chances are 1 in 2 (1–3 on 1d6).

Once an image is hit, it is destroyed. If an attack roll fails to hit you, it destroys an image but has no additional effect (even if the attack would normally have an effect on a failure). If an attack roll is a critical hit and would hit one of the images, one of the images is destroyed and you discard one hit from the attacking dice pool. Once all the images are destroyed, the spell ends.

You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, it must first roll the die indicated above to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as [blindsight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/VisionandLight/#blindsight), or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with [truesight](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Environment/VisionandLight/#truesight).
