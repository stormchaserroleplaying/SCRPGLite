# Species
In this section, you will find the species that you can choose from when building your character. Your characterâ€™s species determines their physical appearance, as well as other physical aspects like size and speed. These and all other species features stem from your character's *biology*. Keep in mind that nurture plays as much of a role in development as nature; while you may be used to seeing fantasy media portraying pastoral, friendly halflings, the culture and background that you choose can provide the stepping stones needed to create a competitive and secretive halfling wizard. You can choose only one species to gain features from.

## Age
You can choose any age for your character. Advanced age modifies your attribute scores. Age brackets vary with species. These effects are described individually and are not cumulative.

| Age Bracket | Effects |
|:-----------:|:-------:|
| Middle Age | -1 to Str, Dex or Con. +1 to Int, Wis or Cha. |
| Elderly    | -1 to two of Str, Dex and Con. +1 to two of Int, Wis and Cha.<br>Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |
| Venerable  | -1 to Str, Dex and Con. +1 to Int, Wis and Cha.<br>Movement speed is reduced by 5 ft. |

## Features
The description of each species includes features that are common to members of that species. For example, every species increases one or more of a character's physical attribute scores.

If a feature calls for an innate attack roll, then this is a Constitution-based attack roll. Proficieny talents for innate attacks can be found [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Species/#innate-ability-proficiency).

## Phenotype
Some species can be classified into distinct phenotypical groupings. Members of a given phenotype have all of the features of their species, along with some specific to their phenotype. Relationships between phenotypical groups vary significantly.

## Size
This tells you the physical size of members of the species. Medium corresponds roughly to the height and weight range of a human adult, and Small is roughly half of that.

## Speed
Each time that a creature spends an action (such as [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Stride/)) to move, they move their speed.

All creatures have a base speed of:

<center><strong>Speed in Feet = ( Strength Score + Dexterity Score )</strong></center>

This entry modifies a creature's base speed, depending on it species.
