* You can hold a **Small** and **Medium** weapon in each hand, granting you an extra attack.
* **Large** weapons can be held with both hands, dealing 1d10 damage.
* **Huge** weapons require both hands. Some huge weapons can attack monsters up to 10 feet away, but can’t be used to attack monsters within 5 feet.
* **Huge melee weapons** and all **ranged weapons** can’t be used with a shield.
