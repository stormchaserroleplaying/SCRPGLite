# Equipment
Pick 2 weapons, or 1 weapon and a shield.
* **Huge** and **Ranged** weapons can’t be used with a shield.
* You can hold a **Small** and **Medium** weapon in each hand, granting you an extra attack.
* **Large** weapons can be held with both hands, granting +1 damage.
* **Huge** weapons require both hands. Some huge weapons can attack monsters up to 10 feet away, but can’t be used to attack monsters within 5 feet.
