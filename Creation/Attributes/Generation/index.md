# Generating Attributes
The Stormchaser RPG allows you to build a character with a set of attributes that you choose individually. The character point values of attributes can be found below.

| Attribute | Point cost at creation | Point cost to advance to this value |
|:---------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| 6 | -6 | - |
| 7 | -4 | 2 |
| 8 | -2 | 2 |
| 9 | -1 | 1 |
| 10 | 0 | 1 |
| 11 | 1 | 1 |
| 12 | 3 | 2 |
| 13 | 5 | 2 |
| 14 | 10 | 5 |
| 15 | 15 | 5 |
| 16 | 25 | 10 |
| 17 | 35 | 10 |
| 18 | 50 | 15 |
| 19 | - | 15 |
| 20 | - | 20 |

For example, a score of 14 is worth 10 points. 

At creation, your score may not exceed 18.

Your GM will tell you how many points you have to spend on your attributes. Typically, this is a portion of your total character point budget, e.g. 30 points out of 150. 18 is the highest attribute that you can end up with, before applying species and background increases, and 6 is the lowest.

This method of determining attributes enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones, a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal, or any set of numbers between those extremes.

| Campaign Type | Character Point Budget for Attributes |
|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Low Fantasy | 10 |
| Standard Fantasy | 30 |
| High Fantasy | 70 |

## Array
Using an array gives all players the same set of numbers to assign to their attributes in any order that they like. This approach is even-handed and produces a party of characters with a similar balance of attributes.

| Campaign Type | Array | Character Point Value |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-:|
| Low Fantasy | 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8 | 6 |
| Standard Fantasy | 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 | 32 |
| High Fantasy | 16, 15, 14, 14, 13, 12 | 68 |

## Rolling
Some GMs and players prefer to introduce an element of chance by rolling for attributes. If you roll for attributes, you still calculate the value of the statline that you have rolled and subtract it from your points budget when you are done.

This method is quite random, and some characters may have clearly superior abilities. This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to specific attributes in the order they are rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts and are best designed around their attributes.

### Low Fantasy
Roll 3d6, rerolling all 1s, and add the dice together. Record the total and repeat the process until you have six numbers. Assign these results to your attributes as you see fit.

### Standard Fantasy
Roll 4d6. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your attributes as you see fit.

### High Fantasy
Roll 4d6, rerolling all 1s. Discard the lowest die result and add the three remaining results together. Record the total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these totals to your attributes as you see fit.
