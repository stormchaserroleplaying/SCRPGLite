# Other Statistics
Every character begins play with a d4 [recovery die](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Die/Recovery/) and a d4 [martial die](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Die/Martial/). Many talents (such as martial arts, rage, or sneak attack) use your martial die to determine how much damage you do. Your recovery die also determines how quickly you recover from damage, such as during a short rest or as the target of a healing spell.

In addition to this, your martial die determines your probability of success when performing martial feats.

## Martial Feats
Often, adventurers earn their gold with pure physical prowess. They swing across chapels on chandelier chains, bash through iron-banded oaken doors, and leap over chasms in pursuit of their foes. When locked in mortal melee, their martial feats turn the course of battle: a brazen bull rush to push back the enemy lines, a swinging flail to entangle the beastman’s sword arm, or a well-placed dagger through the enemy knight’s visor.

Prior to any attack roll, a martial feat, or feat for short, can be declared. This feat is a dramatic combat maneuver within the scope of the current combat. For example, a character may try to disarm an enemy with his next attack, or trip the opponent, or smash him backward to open access to a nearby corridor. The feat does not increase damage but could have some other combat effect: pushing back an enemy, tripping or entangling it, temporarily blinding it, and so on.

The feat die determines the feat's success. This is a d4 and can be enlarged by taking talents from the martial feat talent tree. If the feat die meets a DC (typically 3, but higher at GM discretion) and the attack hits, then the feat succeeds. If the feat die is not equal to or higher than the DC, or the overall attack misses, then the feat fails as well.

## Mana
You have 3 mana with which to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. This is also your **mana maximum**. To cast one of these spells, you must expend an amount of mana equal to the spell’s level. You regain all expended mana when you finish a [long rest](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Resting/Long/).

You can increase your mana maximum by taking [magic talents](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Magic/).

## Stamina
Your character's stamina defines how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. You start with stamina equal to your Constitution score. This is also your **stamina maximum**. You regain all expended stamina when you finish a [long rest](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Resting/Long/).

You can increase your stamina maximum by increasing your Constitution score, or increasing your [recovery die](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Die/Recovery/) size.
