# Advancement
As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, they gain experience. Eventually, this leads to advancements in capability by gaining and spending character points, which can be used to purchase new abilities. Characters advance based on when they accomplish significant story goals in the campaign. The GM tells the players when their characters gain character points, which may be spent in the following ways:

| Benefit | Character Points |
|:-------:|:----------------:|
| Armour Training | 1 |
| Armour Expertise | 5 |
| Armour Mastery | 15 |
| Defence Training | 5 |
| Defence Expertise | 15 |
| Defence Mastery | 35 |
| Increase an Attribute by 1 | See Below |
| Language (Broken) | 1 |
| Language (Accented) | 5 |
| Language (Native) | 15 |
| Learn an additional spell | See Below |
| Skill Training | 2 |
| Skill Expertise | 10 |
| Skill Mastery | 25 |
| Spell School Training | 5 | 
| Spell School Expertise | 15 |
| Spell School Mastery | 35 |
| Subskill | 1 |
| Tool Training | 1 |
| Tool Expertise | 5 |
| Tool Mastery | 15 |
| Weapon Training | 2 |
| Weapon Expertise | 10 |
| Weapon Mastery | 25 |

* Talents costs are listed in the entry for that specific talent.
* You cannot purchase mastery in a skill, tool, or weapon group, unless you are already an expert with that skill, tool, or weapon group. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to master is 37 points for a skill, or weapon group and 16 points for a tool.
* You cannot purchase a language at native level, unless you already speak that language at accented level. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to native is 16 points.
* You cannot increase an attribute score above 20.
* You cannot purchase expertise in a skill, tool, or weapon group, unless you are already trained with that skill, tool, or weapon group. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to expert is 12 points for a skill, or weapon group and 6 points for a tool.
* You cannot purchase a language at accented level, unless you already speak that language at broken level. Thus the total cost to go from untrained to accented is 6 points.
* When you permanently increase your Intelligence modifier or your proficiency modifier, you may spend additional points as normal. Proficiencies learned by spending points cannot be lost once gained.

## Expertise
You can have expertise with a weapon, skill, tool, or defence that they are already trained with. A character with expertise benefits from an additional +1d on their d20 roll. Additionally, passive scores that benefit from expertise increase by an additional +2, for a total of +6 together with the proficiency bonus.

## Mastery
You can be a master with a weapon, skill, tool, or defence that you are already an expert at. A character with mastery benefits from a third +1d on their d20 roll. Additionally, passive scores that benefit from mastery increase by an additional +1, for a total of +7 together with the proficiency and expertise bonuses.

## Purchasing Improved Attributes
A veteran adventurer may have trained or honed their natural abilities well enough to improve one of their six base attributes. While even the most determined development isnâ€™t enough to turn complete ineptitude into gifted competence, a hard-working adventurer can hone their existing strengths considerably.

Increasing an attribute uses the same character point value scale as at character creation. When you increase an attribute, you pay the difference in cost between the attribute's current value and its new value ([see table](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Creation/Attributes/Generation/)).

If you have a species or background bonus to an attribute, disregard this for the purposes of calculating the cost of your attribute increase. Thus, if you have a species or background bonus to an attribute, you can attain a higher value for less character points.

## Purchasing Additional Spells

| Spell Level | Character Point Cost |
|:-----------:|:--------------------:|
| 1st  | 2 |
| 2nd  | 4 |
| 3rd  | 6 |
| 4th  | 8 |
| 5th  | 10 |
| 6th  | 12 |
| 7th  | 14 |
| 8th  | 16 |
| 9th  | 18 |
| 10th | 20 |

## Stamina
Character points can be spent to increase your attributes. When your Constitution score increases, your stamina maximum also increases. Multiply your new Constitution score by your recovery die multiplier to calculate your new stamina maximum. For example, if your character has a d10 recovery die and a Constitution score of 17 and increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, then their stamina maximum then increases by 4 from 68 to 72.
