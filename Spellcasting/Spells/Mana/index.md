# Mana
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, they can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. The mage and disciple classes quantify this with a pool of mana. For example, a mage that can cast with 2nd level spells has 6 mana.

The amount of mana that you have available to spend is based on your spellcasting talents. Even though you might have enough mana to cast a spell above your maximum spell level, you can't do so without the required spellcasting talent.

When a character casts a spell, they expend an amount of mana equal to that spell's level. So, when the mage from the above example casts *magic missile*, a 1st-level spell, they spend one of their 6 mana and have 5 remaining. You can't reduce your mana total to less than 0.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using mana. For example, a warrior who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a mage who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.

## Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using an amount of mana greater than the spell's level, the spell is cast at a higher level, provided that the amount of mana does not exceed the character's maximum spell level. For example, if a mage that can cast 2nd level spells casts *magic missile* using two mana, then that magic missile is cast at 2nd level.

Some spells, such as *magic missile* and *cure wounds*, are more powerful when cast at a higher level, as detailed in the spell's description.

## Recovering Mana
Finishing a long rest restores any expended mana (see [the rules on resting](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Exploration/Resting/)).

When a spellcaster takes a breather or a short rest, they may roll 1dP + their spellcasting attribute modifier to recover mana.
