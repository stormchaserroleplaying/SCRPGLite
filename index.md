The Stormchaser Roleplaying Game (formerly 'SC5e') has come a long way since it's inception. What began in 2018 as a few house rules for a personal campaign has bloomed into an expansive compendium of rules that makes up a lone standing roleplaying game.

I've taken great pleasure in writing and playtesting this game, but it wouldn't be where it is today without my faithful players and patrons. Throughout the development process, members of the [Stormchaser Roleplaying community](https://discord.gg/HX9EK4A "Join us on Discord!") have contributed both their ideas and their time to brainstorming, reviewing, proof-reading and trialling the contents. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved.

Though inspired by many popular RPGs, including *Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition*, the *Pathfinder Roleplaying Game*, the *Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying Game*, *GURPS* and *World of Darkness*, this game was originally based on *Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition*. If you have questions about the intent behind these rules, please seek me out and I'll be happy to answer any questions.

Within these pages, you will find a revised and refined version of the [first edition of SC5e](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MjzjZBb7BG23h6HaK7J "SC5e Legacy Index") that I wrote from 2018 to 2021. These legacy rules originally grew out of my work with Apostol Apostolov on [Grit and Glory](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LDHolQY2FURKf-8xCT3) and popularised SC5e amongst players looking for a darker and more realistic d20 experience. However, the cost of this realism was that some of these rules required games masters and players to remember many intricate details, which could be easily forgotten and slowed down play.

This new system aims to solve these problems, providing the same visceral feeling in an easier-to-use package. Additionally, the gameplay will be optimised for asynchronous play-by-post, by eliminating unnecessary feedback loops wherever possible. This is an ongoing process and a changelog itemising the updates is posted regularly on [discord](https://discord.gg/JUJY7se "Grit and Glory on Discord").

Enjoy your games!
