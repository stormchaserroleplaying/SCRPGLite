The Stormchaser RPG Lite is a minimalist, OSR-leaning version of the [Stormchaser RPG](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/), derived from a fusion with *Here is Some D&D* by u/LoreMaster00, Christopher Green, Dustin R. and u/1D13. It is primarily written with my children in mind.

Stormchaser is a fantasy tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) where you and a group of friends gather to tell a tale of brave heroes and cunning villains in a world filled with terrifying monsters and amazing treasures. More importantly, Stormchaser is a game where your character's choices determine how the story unfolds.
