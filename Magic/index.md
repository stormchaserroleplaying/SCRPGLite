# Magic
At the beginning of each day, prepare spells. You can prepare a number of spell equal to your spellcasting attribute minus ten (see table below). This is also the number of spells that you may cast in a day.

* Clerics, Druids and Paladins get their spells from their deity or the natural world.
* Sorcerers get their spells through metaphysical forces.
* Warlocks make bargains with extraplanar entities.
* Wizards keep their spells in a spellbook.
