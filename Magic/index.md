# Magic
Your talents determine your spellcasting type.

## Prepared Spellcasters
Divine spellcasters (Clerics, Druids and Paladins) get their spells from their deity, or the natural world. At the beginning of each day, they pray to determine the spells granted to them.

Wizards are arcane spellcasters, who know a wide variety of spells, which they keep in a spellbook. At the beginning of each day, a wizard prepares a selection of the spells in their spellbook for use.

Prepared spellcasters prepare a number of spells equal to their spellcasting ability modifier.

## Spontanous Spellcasters
Sorcerers get their spells through metaphysical forces and Warlocks make bargains with extraplanar entities. These are spontaneous spellcasters, who only know a limited number of spells.

Spontaneous spellcasters know a number of spells equal to their spellcasting ability modifier.

## Spellcasting Level
Your spellcasting level is your spellcasting attribute minus ten (see table below).
