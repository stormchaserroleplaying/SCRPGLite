# Creation
Bards believe that the cosmos is a work of art. The creation of the gods and dragons. That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the 'Song of Creation'. Creation bards draw on that primeval song through dance, music, and poetry. Their teachers share this lesson: "Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. They sing now too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance."

Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards to become students of the Song of Creation. Among dragonkin, the Song of Creation is revered, for legends portray the greatest of dragons as two of the song’s first singers.

## Talents

### Mote of Potential
Whenever you give a creature a bardic inspiration die, you can utter a note from the song of creation to create a tiny mote of potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote is intangible and invulnerable. It lasts until the bardic inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that you choose.

When the creature uses the bardic inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die benefits an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, as detailed below:

**Ability Check.** When the creature rolls the bardic inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the bardic inspiration die again and choose which roll to use, as the mote pops and emits colorful, harmless sparks for a moment.

**Attack Roll.** Immediately after the creature rolls the bardic inspiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. Make a spell attack roll vs the Constitution defence of target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. On a hit, they take thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the bardic inspiration die.

**Defence Check.** Immediately after the creature rolls the bardic inspiration die and adds it to a defence check, the mote vanishes with the sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary stamina equal to the number rolled on the bardic inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary stamina).

### Performance of Creation
As an action, you can channel the magic of the Song of Creation to create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or in a liquid that can support it. The gp value of the item can’t be more than 100 gp and the item must be medium or smaller. The item glimmers softly and a creature can faintly hear music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items you can create, see [equipment](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/).

Once you create an item with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 2 mana to use this feature again. You can have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes.

### Performance of Creation II
Large Object

### ### Performance of Creation III
Huge Object

### Animating Performance
As an action, you can animate one large or smaller nonmagical item within 30 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried. The animate item uses the Dancing Item stat block. The item is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 integrity, or until you die.

In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move on its own, but the only action that it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice, not just dodge.

When you use your bardic inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration. Once you animate an item with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 3 mana to use this feature again. You can have only one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature, the first one immediately becomes inanimate.

### Creative Crescendo
When you use your Performance of Creation feature, you can create more than one item at once. The number of items equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of two items). If you create an item that would exceed that number, you choose which of the previously created items disappears. Only one of these items can be of the maximum size you can create; the rest must be small or tiny.

You are no longer limited by gp value when creating items with Performance of Creation.
