# Valour
Bards of valour are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesnâ€™t pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Proficiencies
When you take your first valour talent, you may choose to either gain a fighting style, or gain proficiency with medium armour and 3 martial weapon groups.

## Talents

### Combat Inspiration
*Prerequisite:* Bardic Inspiration<br>
You learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made.

If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt.

### Blade Flourish
You learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed. Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon a ttack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option once per turn.
#### Defensive Flourish
You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your strength or dexterity defense until the start of your next turn.
#### Slashing Flourish
You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.
#### Mobile Flourish
You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 5 feet away from you, plus a number of feet equal to the number you roll on that die. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.

### Extra Attack
*Prerequisite:* Combat Inspiration and 4 Other Talents<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### Battle Magic
*Prerequisite:* Magical Secrets<br>
You have mastered the art of weaving spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Master's Flourish
*Prerequisite:* Blade Flourish, 14 Other Talents<br>
Whenever you use a Blade Flourish option, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.
