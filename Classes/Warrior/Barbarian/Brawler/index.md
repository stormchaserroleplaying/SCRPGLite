***Description Text***

## Talents

### Brawling Fighting Style
*Prerequisite:* Rage<br>
Starting at 3rd level, you learn the brawling fighting style.

You are skilled at using your weight to your advantage. As long as you are not wielding a medium or heavy shield, you gain the following benefits:

- You are proficient with improvised weapons.
- Your unarmed strikes use a d4 for damage.
- When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.

### Bloodied But Unbowed
Starting at 3rd level, when you take damage that reduces you to half your maximum hit points or less, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level + your Constitution modifier. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Haymaker
Starting at 6th level, before you make an attack, you can declare you are swinging wild haymakers. You make all weapon attack rolls until the end of this turn with disadvantage and when you deal damage with a weapon or an unarmed strike you do not roll for the weaponâ€™s damage die, but use the maximum die result instead.

### Lesser Improved Unarmed Strike
Starting at 6th level the damage die of your unarmed strike increases by one size (d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).

### Moxie Fueled Fists
Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

### Improved Unarmed Strike
Starting at 10th level the damage die of your unarmed strike increases by one size (d6 to d8, or d8 to d10).

### Shake It Off
Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Greater Improved Unarmed Strike
Starting at 14th level the damage die of your unarmed strike increases by one size (d8 to d10, or d10 to d12).

### School of Hard Knocks
By 14th level, you've graduated top of the class at the school of hard knocks and you took most of them on the head. You have resistance to psychic damage and gain advantage on saving throws against effects that would make you stunned or unconscious.
