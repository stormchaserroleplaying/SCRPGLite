# Monsters

## Making Monsters
Pick the monsterâ€™s size, type, role and level. Describe the damage based on what the monster would be attacking with: claw, pseudopod, longsword, fire breath, etc. Apply a bonus to the monster's attack based on its level. Powerful attacks recharge on a roll of a 5 or 6 on a d6. Finally, remember that these numbers are just **guidelines** and should be altered to fit the situation.
