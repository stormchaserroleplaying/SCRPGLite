# Monsters

## Making Monsters
Pick the monster’s size, type and role. Describe the damage based on what the monster would be attacking with: claw, pseudopod, longsword, fire breath, etc. Apply a bonus to the monster's attack based on its attributes. Powerful attacks recharge on a roll of a 5 or 6 on a d6. Finally, remember that these numbers are just **guidelines** and should be altered to fit the situation.

## Monster Sizes

| Size       | Initiative | Stamina | Number of Attacks | Damage |
|:----------:|:----------:|:-------:|:-----------------:|:------:|
| Small      | +5         | ×½      | 1                 | d4     |
| Medium     | +3         | ×1      | 1                 | d6     |
| Large      | +1         | ×4      | 2                 | d8     |
| Huge       | -1         | ×8      | 3                 | d10    |
| Gargantuan | -3         | ×12     | 4                 | d12    |
