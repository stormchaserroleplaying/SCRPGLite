# Afflictions
From curses to poisons to diseases, there are a number of afflictions that can affect a creature. While each of these afflictions has a different effect, they all function using the same basic system. All afflictions make an attack roll when they are contracted. On a miss, the creature does not suffer from the affliction and does not need to make any further rolls. On a hit, the creature is afflicted.

Afflictions attack a creature again after a period of time and may inflict certain penalties if they hit. With most afflictions, if a number of attacks miss consecutively, the affliction is removed and no further attacks occur. Some afflictions, usually supernatural ones, cannot be cured by attacks missing and require the aid of powerful magic to remove. Each affliction is presented as a short block of information.

**Name:** This is the name of the affliction.

**Type:** This is the type of the affliction, such as curse, disease, or poison. It might also include the means by which it is transmitted, e.g. contact, ingestion, inhalation, or injury.

**Attack:** This gives the type of defence targeted by the affliction, as well as the attack bonus. Unless otherwise noted, this is also the attack bonus used by the affliction’s effects once it is contracted, as well as that of any attacks that must miss for the affliction to end.

**Onset:** Some afflictions have a variable amount of time before they set in. Creatures that come in contact with an affliction with an onset time are attacked immediately. A miss means that the affliction is avoided and no further attacks occur. A hit means that the creature has contracted the affliction and will be attacked again after the onset period has elapsed. The affliction’s effect does not occur until further attacks hit after the onset period has elapsed.

**Frequency:** This is how often the periodic attack occurs after the affliction has been contracted (after the onset time, if the affliction has any). While some afflictions last until they are cured, others end prematurely, even if the character is not cured through other means. If an affliction ends after a set amount of time, it will be noted in the frequency. For example, a disease with a frequency of “1/day” lasts until cured, but a poison with a frequency of “1/round for 6 rounds” ends after 6 rounds have passed.

Afflictions without a frequency occur only once, immediately upon contraction (or after the onset time).

**Effect:** This is the effect that the character suffers each time if the affliction's attack hits. Most afflictions cause ability damage or hit point damage. These effects are cumulative, but they can be cured normally. Other afflictions cause the creature to take penalties or other effects. These effects are sometimes cumulative, with the rest only affecting the creature if it was hit by the most recent attack. Some afflictions have different effects after the first attack hits. These afflictions have an initial effect, which occurs when the first attack hits, and a secondary effect, when additional attacks hit, as noted in the text. Hit point and ability score damage caused by an affliction cannot be healed naturally while the affliction persists.

**Cure:** This tells you how the affliction is cured. Commonly, this is a number of attacks that must miss consecutively. Even if the affliction has a limited frequency, it might be cured prematurely if enough attacks miss. Hit point damage and ability score damage is not removed when an affliction is cured. Such damage must be healed normally. Afflictions without a cure entry can only be cured through powerful spells, such as *protection from poison* and *remove curse*. No matter how many attacks miss, these afflictions continue.
