# Backgrounds
The next step in creating your character’s origin is choosing their background. A character’s background tells a story about the life that they have chosen to lead, separate from the culture that they were raised in. This step can be used to tell nearly any story; how your character became an adventurer, why they claim a culture other than the one associated with their species, or how they began their journey towards finding their place in the world.

While picking a background does not have to complete your character’s story, it provides a sturdy base for developing that story. A character’s background typically reflects the individual training that they have sought out or been given, rather than the common species and culture, which they shared with their first community. One of the most important questions that you can ask when choosing your background is how does this relate to your character’s current adventuring status? Did they leave a job that they loved to adventure out of a sense of duty, or were they forced out of their home? Did they spend their inheritance on adventuring gear in search of excitement, or did they save their meager wages until they could embark on a journey bigger than any that they’ve taken yet? After being dealt their cards in life, how did they make the most of it, or did they set off in search of a new hand?

The backgrounds in this chapter provide mechanical benefits, such as attribute score increases, as well as more roleplay-oriented benefits. As with the other origin sections, you gain the benefits of only one background. The following sections appear in the descriptions for most backgrounds.

## Attribute Score Increase
Most backgrounds increase two of a character’s mental attribute scores by 1 (both of these increases might apply to the same attribute). This reflects the abilities utilised or valued the most by that background.

Some selected backgrounds increase only one of a character's mental attribute scores by 1, but also add +1d to the character's awareness.

## Connections
Each occupation provides examples of one acquaintance, ally, or enemy that has had an effect on your character’s life. This could be a childhood friend, a sparring partner, or even a business competitor. Make sure to include your GM when choosing your connection; you never know when they’ll show back up.

## Equipment
Suggested equipment sets are included with each occupation, along with an associated gold cost.  If you use [the optional rule to spend coin on gear](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Starting/), you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.

## Memento
Each occupation includes options for a memento. This is a sentimental item reflective of your background and the occurrences that have built you into who you are, typically worth less than 30 gold.

## Background Feature
Every background comes with a feature that helps determine how your character interacts with the world and people around them. While they rarely provide a set mechanical benefit, they can provide you with a reliable way to find information, shelter, or even financial support.
