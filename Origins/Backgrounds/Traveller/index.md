# Traveller
Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.

You aren’t one of those folks.

You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk realise that it exists. The chances are good that, even if some people that you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of the world for your own reasons, which you may or may not choose to share.

Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land’s ways to be strange and uncomfortable, you can also be sure that some things that its people take for granted will be new wonders that you’ve never laid eyes on before. By the same token, almost anywhere that you go, you are a person of interest to those around you, for good or ill.

## Equipment
One set of traveller’s clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set that you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in the world, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland’s craftsmanship and a pouch containing 5 gp

## Why Are You Here?
A traveller might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided.

## Feature: All Eyes on You
Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

You can parley this attention into access to people and places that you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.
