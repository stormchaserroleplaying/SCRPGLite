# Glory
Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions so they're all ready when destiny calls.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of Glory
The tenets of the Oath of Glory drive a paladin to attempt heroics that might one day shine in legend.
* **Actions over Words.** Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.
* **Challenges Are but Tests.** Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.
* **Hone the Body.** Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.
* **Discipline the Soul.** You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.

### Bonus Spells
As a glory paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of Glory
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Peerless Athlete
As a bonus action, for the next 10 minutes, you have +1d on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

#### Inspiring Smite
Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

### Aura of Alacrity
#### *Cost:* 15 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Oath of the Glory and Aura of Protection
Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

### Glorious Defense
#### *Cost:* 65 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Cleansing Touch and Aura of Alacrity
Each round, the first time that you or another creature that you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by a melee or ranged attack roll, if the attack hits by a margin smaller than your spellcasting modifier, the attack misses. When this oath power successfully triggers, if the attacker is within your weapon's range, they must make a defence check vs your weapon skill or be hit by your melee attack.

On your turn, you may specify targets that you will or will not use this power to defend. The power will only be used on allied creatures unless explicitly stated otherwise.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Living Legend
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Greater Auras and Glorious Defense
You can empower yourself with the legends—whether true or exaggerated—of your great deeds. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining +1d on all Charisma checks.
* Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.
* If you fail a defence check, you can reroll it. You must use this new roll.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
