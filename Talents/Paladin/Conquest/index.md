# Conquest
The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn't enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of Conquest
A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.
* **Douse the Flame of Hope:** It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies' will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.
* **Rule with an Iron Fist:** Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.
* **Strength Above All:** You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.

### Bonus Spells
As a conquest paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of Conquest

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Conquering Presence

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

##### **Actions:** 2
Make a spell attack vs the Wisdom defence of each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can make a Wisdom defence against your spell skill at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Guided Strike
When you make an attack roll, you can use Guided Strike to gain +1d to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Aura of Conquest

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Oath of the Conquest and Aura of Protection
*You constantly emanate a menacing aura while you're not incapacitated.* The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.

### Scornful Rebuke

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 65 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Cleansing Touch and Aura of Conquest
Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of 1) if you're not incapacitated.

### Invincible Conqueror

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Greater Auras and Scornful Rebuke<br>**Actions:** 2
*You gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess.* You can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You have resistance to all damage.
* Once per turn, when you take the Strike action on your turn, you do not count as having made an attack for the purposes of calculating your multiattack penalty.
* Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
