# Hunter
While all paladins are true believers, not all are the knights in shining armour with glimmering blades portrayed in legends. Some paladins prefer unconventional tactics and forms.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of the Hunter
* **Predator.** Be the hunter. Never the hunted.
* **Preparation.** Know your prey. Know how it hunts.
* **Precaution.** Strike from afar. Strike without warning.
* **Precision.** Strike fast. Strike true.

### Bonus Spells
As a hunter paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of the Hunter
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Hunter's Blessing
As a bonus action, you can use your oath to imbue your ranged weapon attacks with holy power. For the next minute you can use your Divine Smite ability when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack.

#### Divine Instinct
As an action you can use your oath to identify the telltale signs of your chosen prey. For 1 hour, you have +1d on Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks that you make to find it. Based on tracks and other traces it has left behind, you immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities. While pursuing your prey, difficult terrain doesn't slow you or your group's travel.

### Shared Precision
#### *Cost:* 15 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Oath of the Hunter and Aura of Protection
When you hit a creature with a ranged attack, you can use your bonus action to grant your allies within 10 feet of you +1d to hit that target until the start of your next turn. Your allies must remain within 10 feet of you, and must be able both to see and hear you to gain this benefit.

### Back in the Fight
#### *Cost:* 65 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Cleansing Touch and Shared Precision
You are an expert in guiding and advising your companions on how to succeed in the hunt.

You can cast *cure wounds* and *lesser restoration* at a range of 60-feet.

In addition, when you heal another creature, you can also choose to grant it an inspiration die, which it can roll for +1d on any one ability check, attack roll, or defence check that it makes.

### Divine Hunter
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Greater Auras and Back in the Fight
You engage evil from afar, striking down your foes before they can threaten your allies. As an action, you can manifest incredible speed and precision, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You have +1d on all ranged attack rolls.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
* Your ranged weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
