# Thunder
The Oath of Thunder calls to paladins who wish to harness the primal power of the sky itself. Like a thunder storm that strikes with lightning from above, or a whirlwind of destruction that sucks up everything in its path, a Paladin who adheres to this oath becomes thunder incarnate.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of the Thunder
A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of thunder etched deep into their mind:
* **Speak like Thunder.** Your voice shall be heard by all.
* **Strike like Lightning.** Be swift, be forceful, be strong.
* **Conduct Power.** Let your unwavering energy surge into your companions, and transform them into something greater.
* **Be the Eye of the Storm.** Be the change you want to see.

### Bonus Spells
As a thunder paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of Thunder
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Storm Strike
As an action, you can infuse a ranged or thrown weapon with lightning and make an attack. You create a line of lightning 5 ft wide and 60 ft long that deals 2d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier in lightning damage on a successful spell attack roll vs the target's Dexterity defence, or half that on a miss. The attack roll has +1d if the weapon attack hits.

#### Thunder Leap
As an action, you can choose to jump up to your movement speed in any direction. When you land, lightning explodes around you. Make a spell attack vs the Dexterity defence of all creatures within a 5 foot radius. On a hit, they are knocked back 5 feet and take 2d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier in thunder damage. On a miss, they take half damage and are not knocked back.

### Aura of the Storm

You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause a strong wind to whirl around you until you dismiss it (no action required), causing the following effects:
* Unprotected flames, torch-sized or smaller, are extinguished.
* The area counts as difficult terrain. You can choose any number of creatures to be immune to this effect.
* It expels vapour, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.

### Thunder God
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Greater Auras and Thunder Struck
As an action, you can mantle the powers of a tempest deity. For 1 minute, your body crackles with thunder and lightning, and your eyes glow blue, revealing the raging storm within. You gain the following benefits:
* You are immune to lightning and thunder damage.
* You have a fly speed of twice your walking speed. While you are flying, you deal 1d8 lightning damage to a hostile creature when you enter its reach, and 1d8 thunder damage when you leave its reach. You can deal this damage to a creature when you enter and leave its reach only once per turn.
* Lightning and thunder damage you deal ignores resistance and creatures with immunity to lightning or thunder damage talk half damage. Creatures cannot benefit from the Lightning Absorption trait from damage you deal.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.
