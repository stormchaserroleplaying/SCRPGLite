# Watchers
The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spirits, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats.

Paladins who follow the Watchers' oath are ever vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar forces, often establishing a network of spies and informants to gather information on suspected cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and awareness about one's surroundings is as natural as wearing armor in battle.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of the Watchers
A paladin who assumes the Oath of the Watchers swears to safeguard mortal realms from otherworldly threats.

* **Vigilance.** The threats you face are cunning, powerful, and subversive. Be ever alert for their corruption.
* **Loyalty.** Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or those who truck with them. Stay true to your order, your comrades, and your duty.
* **Discipline.** You are the shield against the endless terrors that lie beyond the stars. Your blade must be forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what lies beyond.

### Bonus Spells
As a watchers paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of the Watchers
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Watcher's Will
As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the chosen creatures have +1d on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma defences.

#### Abjure the Extraplanar
As an action, you present your holy symbol, make a spell attack vs the Wisdom defence of each aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you. On a hit, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can take the Dodge action.

### Aura of the Sentinel
#### *Cost:* 15 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Oath of the Watchers and Aura of Protection
You emit an aura of alertness while you aren't incapacitated. When you and any creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you roll initiative, you all gain +1d to initiative.

### Vigilant Rebuke
#### *Cost:* 65 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Cleansing Touch and Aura of the Sentinel
Each round, the first time that you or another creature that you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma defence, the creature that forced the defence takes 2d8 + your spellcasting modifier in force damage.

### Mortal Bulwark
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Greater Auras and Vigilant Rebuke
You manifest a spark of divine power in defense of the mortal realms. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.
* You have +1d on attack rolls against aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, and fiends.
* When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, make a spell attack vs the creature's Charisma defence. On a hit, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a miss, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.

Once you use this bonus action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
