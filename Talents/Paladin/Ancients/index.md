# Ancients
The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things — leaves, antlers, or flowers — to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of the Ancients
The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.
* **Kindle the Light:** Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.
* **Shelter the Light:** Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.
* **Preserve Your Own Light:** Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.
* **Be the Light:** Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.

### Bonus Spells
As an ancients paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of the Ancients

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of your oath, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Nature's Wrath

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

##### **Actions:** 2 actions
You can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature is restrained on a successful spell attack roll vs the target's Strength or Dexterity defence. While restrained by the vines, the creature makes a Strength or Dexterity defence against your spell skill at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.

#### Turn the Faithless

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

##### **Actions:** 2 actions
You present your holy symbol, make a spell attack vs the Wisdom defence of each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you. On a hit, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It is limited to 2 actions on its turn, that can only be used for the Stride action or to try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.
