# Oathbreaker
An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.

## Branch Features

### Bonus Spells
As an oathbreaker paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.

### Oath of the Breaker
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
You gain the ability to channel the power of darkness itself, using that energy to fuel the following magical effects.

When you use your oath powers, you expend 1 mana and choose which effect to create. Some oath effects require attack rolls. When you use such an effect, your disciple spell attack roll is used.

#### Control Undead
As an action, you target one undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a spell attack vs the target's Wisdom defence. On a hit, the target must obey your commands for the next 24 hours, or until you use this oath power again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than your total number of paladin talents is immune to this effect.

#### Dreadful Aspect
As an action, you channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Make a spell attack vs the Wisdom defence against each creature you choose within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target is frightened of you for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can make a Wisdom defence against your spell skill at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Aura of Hate
#### *Cost:* 15 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Oath of the Breaker and Aura of Protection
You, as well any fiends and undead within 10 feet of you, gain a bonus to melee weapon damage rolls equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum of +1). A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time.

### Supernatural Resistance
#### *Cost:* 65 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Cleansing Touch and Aura of Hate
You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

### Dread Lord
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Greater Auras and Supernatural Resistance
You surround yourself with an aura of fear and darkness. As an action that lasts 1 minute, the aura reduces any bright light in a 30-foot radius around you to dim light. Whenever an enemy that is frightened by you starts its turn in the aura, it takes 4d10 psychic damage. Additionally, you and creatures you choose in the aura are draped in deeper shadow. Creatures that rely on sight have -1d on attack rolls against creatures draped in this shadow.

While the aura lasts, you can use a bonus action on your turn to cause the shadows in the aura to attack one creature. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 3d10 + your spellcasting modifier.

After activating the aura, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
