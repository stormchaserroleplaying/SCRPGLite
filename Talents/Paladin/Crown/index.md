# Crown
The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.

## Branch Features

### Tenets of the Crown
The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasise the following tenets.
* **Law.** The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.
* **Loyalty.** Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.
* **Courage.** You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?
* **Responsibility.** You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.

### Bonus Spells
As an crown paladin, you gain the following spells once you can cast spells of that level. Once you gain an oath spell, you always have it prepared and it doesn’t count against the number of spells that you can prepare each day.

If you have an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the divine spell list, that spell is nevertheless a divine spell for you.
