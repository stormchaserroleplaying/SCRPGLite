See [Spells Rules](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/) for the general rules of spellcasting.

## Divine Spellcasting
The power of your spells comes from your devotion and attunement to a higher power.

### Spellcasting Attribute
You must choose a mental attribute to be your spellcasting attribute: Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

You use your chosen ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use the modifier of your chosen attribute when making an attack roll with a spell that you cast.

### Preparing Spells
You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/). When you do so, choose a number of 1st level divine spells equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. For example, if you have a spellcasting attribute of 16, you can prepare a total of 3 1st level divine spells. Casting a spell does not remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a short rest. Preparing a new list of divine spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol or druidic focus (see [Adventuring Gear](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/AdventuringGear/)) as a spellcasting focus for your divine spells.

### Cantrips
You may choose a number of cantrips from the [Divine Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Divine/) equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. If your spellcasting attribute modifier increases, then you learn additional cantrips of your choice.
