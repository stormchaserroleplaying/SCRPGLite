## Arcane Spellcasting

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Spellcasting Attribute of 11 or Higher
Choose one of the three following traditions:
* Occultism: You have formed a pact with a higher power.
* Sorcery: Your spells harness the magic in your blood and project your will onto the world.
* Wizardry: You learn your spells through dedicated study and memorisation.

### Spellcasting Attribute
You must choose an attribute to be your spellcasting attribute. The attributes that you may choose from depend on your tradition:
* Occultism: Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
* Sorcery: Constitution or Charisma
* Wizardry: Intelligence or Wisdom

You use your chosen ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use the modifier of your chosen ability when making an attack roll with a spell that you cast.

### Spells Known
You begin play knowing a number of spells from the [Arcane Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Arcane/) equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. If your spellcasting attribute modifier ever changes, you learn new spells, or lose access to existing spells, depending on whether the modifier increases or decreases.

Choose one sorcerer, warlock, or wizard talent tree branch that you have talent(s) from. You gain the bonus 1st level spells listed in that branch's bonus spells table.

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (see [Adventuring Gear](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/AdventuringGear/)) as a spellcasting focus for your arcane spells.

### Cantrips
You may choose a number of cantrips from [Arcane Spell List](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/Lists/Arcane/) equal to your spellcasting attribute modifier. If your spellcasting attribute modifier increases, then you learn additional cantrips of your choice.
