# Engineer Talent Tree

A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with every sort of tool, carefully screwing a gear into place amidst a complex maze of clockwork. The device begins to tick and she and watches with a smile of pride as the automaton straightens and stands.

A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf, who slides a long, brass tube from across his back. With a thundering boom, a gout of fire and shrapnel erupts from the tube, and the troll's growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee.

With a thunderous crash a figure lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a towering presence stands amidst the war-torn scene, clad in mechanical plate mail with smoke billowing from a chimney on the back. The glowing visor swivels to inspect the wreckage. It raises a gauntlet, and lightning crackles forth.

Makers of mechanical objects and devices, engineers are defined by their inventive nature. Where a wizard studies magic, they turn to science to unlock the mysteries of the universe thorough study and investigation.

Every engineer is defined by a specific craft. Engineers see mastering the basic methods of a craft as the first step to true progress, the invention of new methods and approaches. Engineers are students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, steam-powered armour, and mechanical beings that they can augment with additional mechanisms.

All engineers are united by their curious and inventive nature. To an engineer, science is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year. Engineers value novelty and discovery. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.
