# Maverick
Rulebreakers, groundbreakers, and, often, heartbreakers, mavericks are those loose cannons who dance on a razor’s edge and live life like there’s no tomorrow. Armed with a quick wit and quicker trigger, they’re out to make a name for themselves no matter the cost—and to the Hells with anyone, or anything, that stands in their way.
