#### **Cost:** 25 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Dragonkin and 4th level spells or a d6 martial die
You can use 2 actions to take the form of a medium-sized dragon of your phenotype. This effect is similar to *Polymorph*, but you retain your own stamina, ability scores, defences, etc. The transformation lasts for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a bite attack that deals 1dM piercing damage, a claw attack that deals 1dM slashing damage and a flying speed equal to your walking speed that allows you to hover. Any armour and other equipment that you are wearing is absorbed by the transformation and your DR changes to 5. Once you use this talent, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Metallic Dragonkin Phenotype and 3rd level spells or a d6 martial die

Using 2 actions you can use your breath weapon's destructive energy in new ways. Your phenotype determines the size and shape of the exhalation. When you use this trait, choose one of the following:

- **Enervating Breath.** When you use your enervating breath, make an innate attack roll vs the Constitution defence of each creature in the area. On a hit, a creature becomes incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

- **Repulsion Breath.** When you use your repulsion breath, make an innate attack roll vs the Constitution defence of each creature in the area. On a hit, a creature is pushed 20 feet away from you and knocked prone.

Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
