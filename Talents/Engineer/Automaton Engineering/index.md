### Automaton Companion
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* 5 Total Character Points
At 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you've accumulated to create and customize your own personalised automaton companion. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 50 gp worth of materials to finally finish your automaton, which has the following features:.

<!--***_BELOW NEEDS REWORKING_***-->
#### Hit Points
* **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per automaton level<br>
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + its Constitution modifier<br>
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + its Constitution modifier per automaton level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
* **Armor:** All armour<br>
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons<br>
* **Tools:** None<br>
* **Languages:** Automatons can understand common and one language of your choice.<br>
* **Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution<br>
* **Skills:** Two of Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth

#### Features
* **Creature Type:** Construct<br>
* **Size:** Medium<br>
* **Speed:** 30 ft.<br>
* **Condition Immununities:** Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Paralysed, Poisoned
* **Damage Immunities:** Necrotic, Poison, Psychic<br>
* **Vulnerabilities:** Lightning. Additionally, your automaton has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deal lightning damage.

Your automaton has an Intelligence score of 3 and a Charisma score of 1. Assign your automaton’s remaining ability scores as you see fit, using the following scores:
* 15, 14, 13, 12.

An automaton cannot benefit from magical healing or rests, and is instead restored to full hit points after it undergoes maintenance. If your automaton is irreparably destroyed, or you want to construct a different automaton, it costs 50 gp per automaton level and one full day of work. You may only have one automaton companion at a time and it takes 1 hour to change the target of this feature. 

Additionally, you can upgrade your automaton. Your automaton companion has 1 upgrade slot, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Upgrades column of the engineer class table. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of upgrades up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

Your automaton gains a variety of benefits while it is your companion:

* The automaton obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your automaton acts on its own.
* Your automaton's level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your automaton companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.
* Your automaton has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.
* Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your automaton's abilities also improve. Your automaton can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. Your automaton cannot increase its Intelligence or Charisma, and, as normal, it cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature, unless its description specifies otherwise.
* Your automaton cannot wear armour, but you can integrate armour into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armour in order to integrate it into your automaton. Your automaton must be proficient in armour in order to have it integrated.

### Automaton Upgrades
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* 35 Total Character Points

Your Automaton Companion gains 1 Upgrade Slot which can be used to install Automaton Upgrades. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of Upgrades up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

This talent can be taken multiple times when your character reaches specific Character Point totals (70, 115, 145, 180, 220, 325, 395, and 545).

### Potent Integration
#### *Cost:* 5 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Automaton Engineering, Potent Integration & 5 Total Character Points
When your automaton makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to expend one use of your Potent Aptitude to give it a boost. Roll the die and add it to both the attack and damage rolls, if the attack hits.

### Coordinated Attack
#### *Cost:* 20 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Automaton Engineering, Potent Integration & 95 Total Character Points
Once per round, when you take the Strike action, if your companion can see you, it can make a weapon attack against the same creature if it is able to.

While your automaton can see you, it has +1d on all defence checks.'

### Superior Automaton Defence
#### *Cost:* 80 Character Points
#### *Prerequisite:* Automaton Defence & 480 Total Character Points
Once per round, whenever an attacker that your automaton can see hits it with an attack, it halves the attack's damage against it.

<!--Upgrades-->

### Automaton Upgrades
If an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

#### Ablative Armour
You install very hard armour on your automaton that is designed to fracture as it absorbs incoming blows. This armour has 2 uses. As a reaction, your automaton can spend 1 to use the *ablative armour* invention.

You can choose this upgrade multiple times. Each time you do so, the armour gains another 2 uses. All expended uses are regained after the automaton undergoes maintenance.

#### Advanced Steam Engine
*Prerequisite: 7th level, d10 Hit Die*<br>
You greatly improve the steam engine of your automaton. Its Hit Die becomes a d12.

#### Alarm Protocol
You install an alarm module in your automaton, granting the following benefits:

* Your automaton gains +1d to initiative.
* You can’t be surprised while your automaton is active.

#### Augmented Celerity
You augment your automaton to move a little faster. Your automaton’s speed increases by 5 feet.

You can choose this upgrade twice.

#### Augmented Senses
You augment your automaton with advanced sensors, granting the following benefits:

* Your automaton has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to detect the presence of secret doors.
* Your automaton has advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.
* Your automaton has resistance to damage dealt by traps.
* Your automaton can search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only at a slow pace.

#### Durability Module
You enhance your automaton’s durability, granting the following benefits:

* When your automaton rolls a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points your automaton can regain from the roll equals twice your automaton’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
* Your automaton’s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice its level when you make this upgrade. Whenever your automaton gains a level thereafter, its hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points.

#### Emergency Countermeasures
*Prerequisite: 15th level, System Redundancy*<br>
You upgrade your automaton’s system redundancy. When your automaton’s System Redundancy is triggered, it can immediately use its reaction to make one attack roll against a target within range. If the target is the source of the damage that reduced your automaton to 0, the attack roll has advantage.

#### Expertise Protocol
*Prerequisite: 5th level*<br>
You upgrade your automaton, granting it expertise in a skill. Choose a skill that your automaton is proficient in. Your automaton gains expertise in it.

#### False Combustion
You upgrade your automaton to deceive the enemy. As a reaction in response to taking damage, your automaton can feign an explosion. For 1 minute, your automaton appears to be destroyed to all outward inspection. A creature can use its action to inspect the automaton and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your invention save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

#### Fighting Style
Your automaton adopts a particular style of fighting as its specialty. Choose one Fighting Style option. Your automaton can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if it later gets to choose again.

#### Flamethrower
You install a flamethrower in your automaton. The flamethrower has 2 uses. As an action, your automaton can use the *jet of flame* invention or spend 1 use to use the *flame sweep* invention at 1st level. The saving throw is made against your invention save DC. You can use multiple uses to use *flame sweep* at a higher level at a rate of 1 use per level.

You can choose this upgrade twice. The flamethrower regains all uses after the automaton undergoes maintenance.

#### Four-Armed Combatant
*Prerequisite: 9th level*<br>
You install two additional arms to improve your automaton’s combat capabilities, granting it four arms which it can use independently of one another. Your automaton can only gain the benefit of items held by two of its arms at any given time, and once per round your automaton can switch which arms it is benefiting from (no action required).

When your automaton hits a creature with a melee weapon attack on its turn, it can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.

While your automaton has at least 3 arms free, it has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

#### Heavy Plating
Bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage that your automaton takes from non-magical weapons is reduced by an amount equal to its proficiency bonus.

#### Invention Protocol
You install two gadgets and one invention on your automaton. Once your automaton uses the invention, your automaton must undergo maintenance before it can use it again.

* If your automaton can see a creature’s mouth while it is speaking a language it understands, your automaton can interpret what it’s saying by reading its lips.
* Your automaton has a +5 bonus to its passive Wisdom (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.

#### Proficiency Protocol
You upgrade your automaton, granting it proficiency in a tool or skill. Your automaton gains proficiency in a tool or skill of your choice.

#### Prototype Steam Engine
You further improve the steam engine of your automaton. Its Hit Die becomes a d10.

#### Repair Module
*Prerequisite: 11th level, Durability Module*<br>
Your automaton becomes proficient in a saving throw of your choice. Additionally, whenever your automaton takes the Dodge action in combat, it can spend one Hit Die to heal itself. Roll the die, add its Constitution modifier, and it regains a number of hp equal to the total (minimum of one).

#### Shockwave
You install defensive countermeasures on the underbelly of your automaton. This upgrade has 2 uses. As an action, your automaton can use the *overload* invention, consuming 1 use per level. The saving throw is made against your invention save DC.

You can choose this upgrade twice. The countermeasures regain all uses after the automaton undergoes maintenance.

#### System Redundancy
*Prerequisite: 7th level*<br>
You install an emergency protocol in your automaton, prompting a quick reboot after critical damage is taken. If your automaton would be reduced to 0 hit points, it instead is reduced to 1.

Once your automaton uses this feature, it must undergo maintenance before it can use it again.

#### Taser
You install a taser in your automaton. The taser has 2 uses. As an action, your automaton can use the *paralyse person* invention, consuming 1 use. The saving throw is made against your invention save DC.
