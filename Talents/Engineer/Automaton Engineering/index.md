#### Features
Your automaton gains a variety of benefits while it is your companion:
- The automaton obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your automaton acts on its own.
- Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement your automaton can increase one ability score of your choice. Your automaton cannot increase its Intelligence or Charisma, and, as normal, it cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature, unless its description specifies otherwise.
- Your automaton cannot wear armour, but you can integrate armour into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armour in order to integrate it into your automaton. Your automaton must be proficient in armour in order to have it integrated.
- An automaton cannot benefit from magical healing or rests, and is instead restored to full hit points after it undergoes maintenance. If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points.
- If your automaton is irreparably destroyed, or you want to construct a different automaton, it costs 50 gp + 50 gp for every Automaton Upgrades talent you have as well as one full day of work.
- You may only have one automaton companion at a time and it takes 1 hour to change the target of this feature. 

Additionally, you can upgrade your automaton. Your automaton companion has 1 upgrade slot which can be used to install Automaton Upgrades. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of upgrades up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).
