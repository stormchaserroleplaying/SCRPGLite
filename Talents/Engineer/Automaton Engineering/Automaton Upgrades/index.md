# Automaton Upgrades
If an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to install it. You can install the upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites and each upgrade only takes up 1 Upgrade Slot.

## Defensive Upgrades

### Ablative Armour

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades III, d10 Hit Die*<br>
*You install very hard armour on your automaton that is designed to fracture as it absorbs incoming blows.* 

This armour has 2 uses. As a reaction, your automaton can spend 1 to use the *ablative armour* invention.

You can choose this upgrade multiple times. Each time you do so, the armour gains another 2 uses. All expended uses are regained after the automaton undergoes maintenance.

### Advanced Steam Engine

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades III, d10 Hit Die*<br>
You greatly improve the steam engine of your automaton. Its Hit Die becomes a d12.

### Durability Module

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You enhance your automaton’s durability, granting the following benefits:

* When your automaton rolls a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points your automaton can regain from the roll equals twice your automaton’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
* Your automaton’s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice its level when you make this upgrade. Whenever your automaton gains a level thereafter, its hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points.

### Plating, Light

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

Your automaton’s speed increases by 5 feet while light armour is integrated.

### Plating, Medium

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

The maximum Dexterity bonus that your automaton can add to AC increases to 3 from 2 while medium armour is integrated.

### Plating, Heavy

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

Bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage that your automaton takes from non-magical weapons is reduced by an amount equal to its proficiency bonus.

### Prototype Steam Engine

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You further improve the steam engine of your automaton. Its Hit Die becomes a d10.

### Repair Module

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades V, Durability Module*<br>
Your automaton becomes proficient in a saving throw of your choice. Additionally, whenever your automaton takes the Dodge action in combat, it can spend one Hit Die to heal itself. Roll the die, add its Constitution modifier, and it regains a number of hp equal to the total (minimum of one).

### System Redundancy

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades III*<br>
You install an emergency protocol in your automaton, prompting a quick reboot after critical damage is taken. If your automaton would be reduced to 0 hit points, it instead is reduced to 1.

Once your automaton uses this feature, it must undergo maintenance before it can use it again.

## Offensive Upgrades

### Emergency Countermeasures

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades VII, System Redundancy*<br>
You upgrade your automaton’s system redundancy. When your automaton’s System Redundancy is triggered, it can immediately use its reaction to make one attack roll against a target within range. If the target is the source of the damage that reduced your automaton to 0, the attack roll has advantage.

### False Combustion

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You upgrade your automaton to deceive the enemy. As a reaction in response to taking damage, your automaton can feign an explosion. For 1 minute, your automaton appears to be destroyed to all outward inspection. A creature can use its action to inspect the automaton and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your invention save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

### Fighting Style

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

Your automaton adopts a particular style of fighting as its specialty. Choose one Fighting Style option. Your automaton can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if it later gets to choose again.

### Flamethrower

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You install a flamethrower in your automaton. The flamethrower has 2 uses. As an action, your automaton can use the *jet of flame* invention or spend 1 use to use the *flame sweep* invention at 1st level. The saving throw is made against your invention save DC. You can use multiple uses to use *flame sweep* at a higher level at a rate of 1 use per level.

You can choose this upgrade twice. The flamethrower regains all uses after the automaton undergoes maintenance.

### Four-Armed Combatant

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades IV*<br>
You install two additional arms to improve your automaton’s combat capabilities, granting it four arms which it can use independently of one another. Your automaton can only gain the benefit of items held by two of its arms at any given time, and once per round your automaton can switch which arms it is benefiting from (no action required).

When your automaton hits a creature with a melee weapon attack on its turn, it can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target.

While your automaton has at least 3 arms free, it has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

### Shockwave

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You install defensive countermeasures on the underbelly of your automaton. This upgrade has 2 uses. As an action, your automaton can use the *overload* invention, consuming 1 use per level. The saving throw is made against your invention save DC.

You can choose this upgrade twice. The countermeasures regain all uses after the automaton undergoes maintenance.

### Taser

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You install a taser in your automaton. The taser has 2 uses. As an action, your automaton can use the *paralyse person* invention, consuming 1 use. The saving throw is made against your invention save DC.

You can choose this upgrade twice. The taser regains all uses after the automaton undergoes maintenance.

## Support Upgrades

### Alarm Protocol

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You install an alarm module in your automaton, granting the following benefits:

* Your automaton gains a +5 bonus to initiative.
* You can’t be surprised while your automaton is active.

### Augmented Celerity

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You augment your automaton to move a little faster. Your automaton’s speed increases by 5 feet.

You can choose this upgrade twice.

### Augmented Senses

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You augment your automaton with advanced sensors, granting the following benefits:

* Your automaton has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to detect the presence of secret doors.
* Your automaton has advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.
* Your automaton has resistance to damage dealt by traps.
* Your automaton can search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only at a slow pace.

### Expertise Protocol

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades II*<br>
You upgrade your automaton, granting it expertise in a skill. Choose a skill that your automaton is proficient in. Your automaton gains expertise in it.

### Invention Protocol

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You install two gadgets and one invention on your automaton. Once your automaton uses the invention, your automaton must undergo maintenance before it can use it again.

### Jumper Rockets

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You install a rockets in your automaton's legs. These rockets have 2 uses. As an action, your automaton can use the *rocket boots* invention, consuming 1 use.

### Observant Protocol

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

*Prerequisite: Automaton Upgrades III, Alarm Protocol*<br>
You modify the alarm module in your automaton, granting the following benefits:

* If your automaton can see a creature’s mouth while it is speaking a language it understands, your automaton can interpret what it’s saying by reading its lips.
* Your automaton has a +5 bonus to its passive Wisdom (Perception) and passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.

### Proficiency Protocol

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

You upgrade your automaton, granting it proficiency in a tool or skill. Your automaton gains proficiency in a tool or skill of your choice.
