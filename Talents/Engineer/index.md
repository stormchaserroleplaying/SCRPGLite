# Engineer Talent Tree

A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with every sort of tool, carefully screwing a gear into place amidst a complex maze of clockwork. The device begins to tick and she and watches with a smile of pride as the automaton straightens and stands.

A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf, who slides a long, brass tube from across his back. With a thundering boom, a gout of fire and shrapnel erupts from the tube, and the troll's growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee.

With a thunderous crash a figure lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a towering presence stands amidst the war-torn scene, clad in mechanical plate mail with smoke billowing from a chimney on the back. The glowing visor swivels to inspect the wreckage. It raises a gauntlet, and lightning crackles forth.

Makers of mechanical objects and devices, engineers are defined by their inventive nature. Where a wizard studies magic, they turn to science to unlock the mysteries of the universe thorough study and investigation.

Every engineer is defined by a specific craft. Engineers see mastering the basic methods of a craft as the first step to true progress, the invention of new methods and approaches. Engineers are students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, steam-powered armour, and mechanical beings that they can augment with additional mechanisms.

All engineers are united by their curious and inventive nature. To an engineer, science is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year. Engineers value novelty and discovery. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.

### Inventions I

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Intelligence 11
You have access to 1st level inventions.

#### Building Inventions
You begin play having built 2 of the 1st level inventions from your schematic book. When you learn the Schematics Book talent the schematics for these two inventions are included with the book.

You can build additional inventions for any schematic which you have in your book. The maximum number of inventions that you can build is equal to your intelligence modifier times the maximum level of invention which you have access to. For example, if you have access to 2nd level inventions with an intelligence of 16, you can build inventions of a total of 6 levels. This could be 3 2nd level inventions, or 6 1st level inventions.

It takes you 1 hour of concentrated work per level of invention with access to tinker’s tools and materials having materials equal to 50 gp times the level of invention to build it. You can use parts of an already created invention to scrap and apply to a new build. The parts from a scrapped invention have a value of 50 gp per level of the invention. If an invention has been scrapped you must build it again to have it available for use.

#### Invention Ability & Proficiency
Intelligence is the ability associated with your engineer inventions, so you use your Intelligence whenever a schematic refers to your invention ability. Each schematic indicates the weapon or tool proficiency that applies for establishing the dice pool when the invention is used.

#### Invention Uses & Maintenance
Each invention that you build has a number of uses equal to your Intelligence modifier plus 2 times the maximum level of invention that you have access to. These uses last until consumed, and do not expire at the end of each day. For example, if you have access to 2nd level inventions with an Intelligence of 16, your inventions can be used a total of 7 times before maintenance must be performed.

Once all uses of an invention have been consumed it must undergo maintenance, although maintenance may be performed at any time to reset the invention to its maximum number of available uses. Performing maintenance on an invention requires tinker's tools and takes an hour of concentrated work. It also requires materials for replacement parts or consumed ingredients, such as black powder or other fuel source. Sufficient materials for the maintenance cycle of one invention can be found in an urban environment (or any other environment deemed appropriate by your dungeon master) after one hour of scavenging. Alternatively, they can be purchased in advance for 25 gp per invention level.

#### Gadgets
Your most reliable creations are your gadgets, which have been refined to the point of requiring only minimal maintenance. A gadget is an invention that can be used at will, without limited uses or requiring maintenance. Repeated tinkering and refinement has produced a reliable device, which is unlikely to fail or run out of fuel.

You may choose a number of gadgets from the [Gadget List]() equal to your Intelligence modifier. If your Intelligence increases, then you can build additional gadgets of your choice. You can learn to make additional gadgets at the cost of 3 Character Points each. However, the total number of the gadgets that you can have is equal to two times your Intelligence modifier.

Though you have the schematic for your known gadgets in your Schematics Book, this type of invention is so well-known to you that you do not need to refer to your book should you need to rebuild it if a gadget is lost or destroyed.

### Schematics Book

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You are diligent in your efforts to create new devices and, in this process, you collect the various notes and diagrams of the results of your testing which ultimately ends with a blueprint for the creation of a new invention.

You begin play having a number of 1st level schematics equal to 2 plus your intelligence attribute modifier (minimum 3 schematics). If this modifier ever increases, you create new schematics, or lose access to existing schematics, depending on whether the modifier increases or decreases.

#### Finding new Schematics
In your adventures you may come across other books or scrolls containing schematics unknown to you. If it is of a level for which you have access to you can spend the time studying it and copying it into your own book. This process takes 1 hour of study per level of the schematic.

### Potent Aptitude

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 15 CP spent in Engineer talents
Your scientific experience lends you uncommon insight that you can use to assist your allies. You gain +1d on the skill check or attack roll made as part of the [Aid](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Aid/) action.

Additionally, you may reroll any Intelligence check that you make that does not benefit from proficiency, but you must take the result. You can add your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier to initiative rolls.

### Tinkerer

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** 15 CP spent in Engineer talents
You gain the ability to temporarily enhance a weapon or suit of armour. At the end of a long rest, you can tinker with one weapon or suit of armour. For the next 24 hours, or until you use this feature again, the object has a +1 bonus to DR if it's a piece of armour or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon.

Once you've used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Intelligence 12, Inventions I and 35 CP spent in Engineer talents
You have access to 2nd level inventions and have learned 3 2nd level schematics of your choice which can be added to you Schematics Book.

### Inventions III
