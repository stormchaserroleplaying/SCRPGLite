# Bloodrager
While many ferocious combatants can tap into a deep reservoir of buried rage, bloodragers have an intrinsic power that seethes within. Like sorcerers, bloodragers’ veins surge with arcane power. While sorcerers use this power for spellcasting, bloodragers enter an altered state in which their bloodline becomes manifest, where the echoes of their strange ancestry lash out with devastating power. In these states, bloodragers can cast some arcane spells instinctively. The bloodrager’s magic is as fast, violent, and seemingly unstoppable as their physical prowess.

## Features

### Bloodcasting

#### **Prerequisite:** Rage and Spellcasting
You gain the ability to [sustain](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spellcasting/Casting/Duration/#sustaining-spells) spells, even while raging, as long as your spellcasting ability is Constitution or Charisma. You can use a simple or martial melee weapon as a spellcasting focus for your spells.

### Bloodline

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points
The power that lies dormant in your blood awakens.

Each bloodrager has a source of magic somewhere in their heritage that empowers their rage. Sometimes this source reflects a distant blood relationship to a powerful being, or is due to an extreme event involving such a creature somewhere in their family's past. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways.

Pick one bloodline. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Bloodline abilities, with exception of languages, can only be used when raging.

#### Abyssal
Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into the essence of your bloodline. While it doesn't manifest in all of your kin, in those moments when you’re bloodraging, you embody its terrifying presence.

You can speak, read, and write Abyssal.

Furthermore, you grow claws while raging. These count as two light finesse weapons that each deal 1d6 points of slashing damage. Once you have learned the Blood Sanctuary talent, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance. Once you have learned the Bloodrage talent, these claws become flaming weapons, which deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a hit.

Additionally, when you rage you can choose to grow one size category larger than your base size, as [Enlarge/Reduce](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/2/Transmutation/#enlargereduce).

#### Divine
Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being.

Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the divine spell list. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace an arcane cantrip or arcane spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the arcane spell list or the diving spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes an arcane spell for you.

In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is an arcane spell for you and does not count against your number of spells known. This spell cannot be replaced.

You can also speak, read and write either celestial or infernal.

| Affinity | Spell |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| Good | *Cure Wounds* |
| Evil | *Inflict Wounds* |
| Law | *Bless* |
| Chaos | *Bane* |
| Neutrality | *Protection from Evil and Good* |

#### Draconic
At some point in your family’s history, a dragon interbred with your bloodline. Now, the sublime monster’s ancient power fuels your bloodrage.

You can speak, read, and write Draconic.

Furthermore, as magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armour, your DR equals 3 + your Constitution modifier.

#### Elemental
The power of the elements resides in you, and at times you can hardly control its fury. This influence comes either from an elemental outsider in your family history or from a moment when you or your ancestors were exposed to a powerful elemental force or cataclysm.

You can speak, read, and write Primordial.

Furthermore, choose one element.

| Element | Damage Type |
|:--------:|:-----:|
| Earth | Acid |
| Air | Lightning |
| Fire | Fire |
| Water | Cold |

You gain resistance to damage of the associated type. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals this kind of damage, magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take 1dM of the same damage type.

#### Giant
You discover innate magical abilities within yourself that are based on your giant heritage.

You can speak, read, and write Giant.

Select one of the giant types from the table below. If you have the spellcasting feature, you learn a cantrip and a 1st level spell. If you can cast 2nd level spells, you also learn a 2nd level spell. If you later gain such abilities, then you learn these spells at that time. The specific spells that you learn are associated with your choice, as shown in the table. These spells count as arcane spells for you, but they don't count against your number of spells known.

| Giant | Cantrips | 1st Level Spell | 2nd Level Spell |

#### Shadow
You are a creature of shadow. Your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. Perhaps you trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it. The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you struggles against the dark energy of your soul.

You have darkvision with a range of 60 feet even when not raging. If you already have darkvision, its range extends to 120 feet. Whenever you enter a rage, the light level within 30 feet of you decreases by one step. If you can cast 2nd level spells, then you learn the darkness spell, which doesn't count against your number of spells known. You can see through the darkness created by the spell.

In addition, you have resistance to cold damage and your melee attacks deal an extra 1dM cold damage.

### Blood Sanctuary

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Bloodline and 50 CP of Barbarian Talents
Due to the power of your blood, you can stand confidently amid the effects of spells cast by you or your allies. You have +1d to your defences against spells that you or an ally casts.

### Bloodrage

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Blood Sanctuary and 110 CP of Barbarian Talents
Upon entering a rage, you can apply the effects of a spell that you know to yourself. The spell must have a range of touch or self. If the spell's duration is greater than 1 round, it instead lasts for the duration of the rage. This use consumes mana as if you had cast the spell.

### Greater Bloodline

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Bloodrage and 225 CP of Barbarian Talents
Your connection to your bloodline is strengthened. You gain additional abilities when raging.

#### Abyssal
Once per round, when you hit in melee, you can choose to exude a burst of hellish flames in a 10-foot radius centered on you. Make a spellcasting attack roll vs all creatures within 10 feet of you. On a hit, each creature takes 2dM + your spellcasting attribute modifier in fire damage, or half as much damage on a miss.

#### Divine
When you rage, you manifest a pair of spectral wings on your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

The affinity that you chose for the source of your divine power determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.

Additionally, once per turn as an action, you can cast your bonus affinity spell on all creatures within 10 feet of you. The mana cost for casting a spell in this way is 1.

#### Draconic
When you rage, you sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armour unless the armour is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

Once per turn as an action, you can beat your wings to create a great burst of wind. Make an unarmed strike vs. the STR defense of each creature within 10 feet of you. On a hit, they suffer 1dM physical damage and are knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/).

#### Elemental
When you rage, you gain special movement based on your element.

| Element | Movement |
|:-------:|:-----:|
| Earth | Burrow speed equal to walking speed |
| Air | Flying speed equal to walking speed |
| Fire | Double walking speed |
| Water | Breathe underwater and swim speed equal to walking speed |

Additionally, you can briefly transform your body and any possessions you are carrying into pure elemental form, allowing you to fit through gaps as small as one inch.

#### Giant
You gain the ability to channel the souls of your ancestors into your physical form.

When you rage you can increase your size by one category as [Enlarge/Reduce](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/2/Transmutation/#enlargereduce). Additionally, each round you receive 1dR + your Constitution modifier in temporary stamina. When you [shove](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Shove/) a smaller creature, you push it 10 ft away from you, and when you [grapple](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Grapple/) a smaller creature you can use it as an improvised melee or thrown weapon, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to the creature's recovery die, plus your Strength modifier. Both the creature you are using as a weapon and any creature you hit with them take this damage.

#### Shadow
You see normally in dim light and darkness, both magical and non-magical, as though it were brightly lit.

Furthermore, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, you can magically teleport as an action to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You cannot use this ability if your bloodrage is the only source of dim light or darkness.
