# Wild Magic
Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Hedge, the higher planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians carry the Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.

## Features

### Magic Awareness
When you take your first talent from this branch, you become aware of the presence of concentrated magic. When you activate this ability as an action, you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you until the end of your next turn. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to.

### Wild Surge
#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage
The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the table below to determine the magical effect produced.

| d8 | Effect |
|:--:|:------:|
| 1 | Shadowy tendrils lash around you. Make am attack roll against the constitution defense of each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target(s) take 1dM necrotic damage. You also gain 1dR temporary stamina when this effect activates. |
| 2 | You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns in place of a [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) action. |
| 3 | An intangible spirit, which looks like any small Beast or Fey creature (your choice), appears within 5 feet of one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, the spirit explodes and you make an attack roll against the dexterity defense of each creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, it inflicts 1dM force damage. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again, summoning another spirit, on each of your turns as an action. |
| 4 | Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding. Until your rage ends, the weapon’s damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. At the end of each turn, if you are not holding the weapon, you can magically recall it to your hand. The weapon travels up to 60 feet in this way along the most direct route to you. If it cannot reach you with this movement, it falls to the ground after 60 feet and you can spend an action on your next turn to recall it in the same way. You can choose to make an attack roll against the dexterity defense of any creature along the return path. On a hit, the creature takes 1dM force damage. |
| 5 | Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before your rage ends, that creature takes 1dM force damage, as magic lashes out in retribution. |
| 6 | Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by multi-coloured, protective lights. You gain +1d to your defence vs melee and ranged attacks. While within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus. |
| 7 | Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you. Until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies. |
| 8 | A bolt of light shoots from your chest. Make an attack roll against the constitution defense of another creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1dM radiant damage and is [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/) until the start of your next turn. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as an action. |

### Bolstering Magic
#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Wild Surge and 50 CP of Barbarian talents
You can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch one creature (which can be yourself) and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to that creature:
* For 10 minutes, the target gains +1d on their attack rolls and ability checks.
* Roll a d3. The creature regains that amount of mana. Once a creature receives this benefit, that creature can’t receive it again until after a long rest.

You can take this action a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Unstable Backlash
#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Bolstering Magic and 125 CP of Barbarian talents
When you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out. At the start of each turn, if you were hit by an attack or otherwise take damage while raging over the course of the last round, then you can roll on the Wild Magic table and immediately produce the effect rolled. This effect replaces your current Wild Magic effect.

### Controlled Surge
#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Unstable Backlash and 225 CP of Barbarian talents
Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
