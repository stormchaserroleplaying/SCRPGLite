# Guardian Ancestor
Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a guardian ancestor barbarian rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.

Barbarians who draw on their guardian ancestors can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their guardian ancestors, these barbarians cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestorsâ€™ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

### Ancestral Protectors

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage
*When you enter your rage, a spectral warrior appears to defend you and your allies.*

While you are raging, the first time each round that you or an ally that you can see within 15 feet of you is targeted by an attack, the target receives +1d to its defences vs that attack.

On your turn (or when you roll initiative), you can declare a specific creature to trigger this ability, or to not use it for the next round. This effect can only trigger once per round. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.

### Spirit Shield

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors and 50 CP of Barbarian talents
*The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend.*

As an action while you are raging, you grant a creature within 30 feet that you can see 2dM temporary stamina. This benefit lasts while you are raging or until you spend an action to use this talent again. If you use this talent's effect after the first application, reroll the temporary stamina amount and grant it to the target creature. If the creature had temporary stamina from this talent already, it is replaced with the new value.

### Consult the Spirits

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Spirit Shield and 125 CP of Barbarian talents
*You gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits.*

You can cast the [augury]() and [clairvoyance]() spells as rituals, without using mana or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Vengeful Ancestors

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 40 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Consult the Spirits and 225 CP of Barbarian talents
*Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate.*

When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of sacred damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.

### Ancestral Protectors, Greater

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Ancestral Protectors and 225 CP of Barbarian talents
You can now protect every ally within range using your Ancestral Protectors. Each ally can benefit from its effect only once per round for the first attack against them.
