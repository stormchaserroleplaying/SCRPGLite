# Totem Warrior
The growth of a Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.

Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

### Totem Spirit

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. You gain the [Beast Sense]() and [Speak With Animals](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Spells/1/Divination/#speak-with-animals) spells.

When you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object (an amulet or similar adornment) that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of an animal connected with the spirit. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow. Many animals can represent a totem spirit, so the player may choose a different animal that relates to those listed.

| Totem | Sample Animals |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
| Bear | Bear, Boar, Bull, Turtle, Whale |
| Stag | Deer, Dolphin, Elk |
| Eagle | Dragon, Eagle, Hawk, Roc |
| Wolf | Hyena, Lion, Wolf |
| Tiger | Lion, Tiger, Crocodile, Snake, Shark |

**Bear:** You have resistance to all damage except mental damage. The Bear Totem makes you tough enough to withstand any punishment.

**Eagle:** You have +1d on defence checks to avoid opportunity attacks and you can [Stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) once per turn without using an action. The Eagle Totem makes you extraordinarily swift.

**Stag:** While you aren't wearing heavy armour, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the stag makes you extraordinarily swift.
