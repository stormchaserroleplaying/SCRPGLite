# Barbed
Known as Kuldjargh (literally “axe idiot”) in Dwarvish, barbed barbarians are dwarf followers of the gods of war and they specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armour. They throw themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.

## Optional Restriction: Dwarves Only
In most settings, only dwarves can become barbed barbarians. They fill a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1dM piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, when you successfully [grapple]((https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Grapple/)) a creature, the target takes 1dM piercing damage. This damage roll recurs on each round that you maintain the grapple.
