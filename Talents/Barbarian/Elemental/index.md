# Elemental Storm
All barbarians harbour a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Some learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, this barbarian taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.

Elemental storm barbarians are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other elemental storm barbarians hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

### Storm Aura

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage
You emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you begin raging. You can activate the effect again on each of your turns as an action. Choose fire, lightning, or cold. Your aura’s effect depends on that chosen element, as detailed below.

**Fire:** You deal 1dM fire damate to each creature that you choose within your aura. 

**Lightning:** Choose one creature that you can see in your aura. Make a rage attack roll vs the target's Dexterity defense. On a hit, the target takes 2dM lightning damage, or half as much damage on a miss.

**Cold:** Roll 1dR. Each creature of your choice in your aura gains temporary stamina equal to the result, as icy spirits inure it to suffering.

### Storm Soul

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Storm Aura and 50 CP of Barbarian talents
The storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment that you chose for your Storm Aura.

**Fire:** You gain resistance to fire damage and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

**Lightning:** You gain resistance to lightning damage and you can [jump](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/Jump/) without needing to [stride](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Moves/Stride/) first. You can [jump](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Skills/Athletics/Jump/) up to your movement speed forward or half your movement speed upward without a roll. If there are obstacles present, then your GM may still require a roll.

**Cold:** You gain resistance to cold damage and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.

### Shielding Storm

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Storm Soul and 125 CP of Barbarian talents
You learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice within your Storm Aura gains the damage resistance granted by the Storm Soul feature.

### Raging Storm

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Shielding Storm and 225 CP of Barbarian talents
The power of the storm that you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment that you chose for your Storm Aura.

**Fire:** Any creature within your Storm Aura that hits you with an attack takes 1dM fre damage.

**Lightning:** When you hit a creature within your Storm Aura with an attack, the target is knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/) if your attack roll exceeds its Strength defense.

**Cold:** Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can make a rage attack roll vs the Strength defense of one creature that you can see within your aura. On a hit, the target's movement speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.
