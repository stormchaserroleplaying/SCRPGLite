### Reckless Strikes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points**Prerequisite:** 15 CP of Barbarian talents
The base damage of your unarmed strikes is now 1dM.

While you are raging and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to suffer -1d on the attack roll to make the attack a reckless strike.

You can use these feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary stamina equal to 1dR + your Constitution modifier. If the target is [grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) by you, then you instead gain temporary stamina equal to 2dR + your Constitution modifier.

#### Punishing Strike
The creature is [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/) until the start of its next turn. If the target is [grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) by you, it is instead [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/) until the start of its next turn.

#### Staggering Strike
Tthe target is pushed back 10 feet. If the target is [grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) by you, it is instead knocked [prone](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Prone/). If the target hits an object before the end of this forced movement, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier.

### Shattering Strikes

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Reckless Strikes and 50 CP of Barbarian talents
*Your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials.*

While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons deal double damage against structures and objects.

### Stop Hitting Each Other

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Shattering Strikes and 110 CP of Barbarian talents
You can [grapple](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Grapple/) creatures up to two sizes larger than you, instead of one size larger than you. 

Additionally, you can use creatures that you have [grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Grapple/) that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so and you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, the [grappled](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Grappled/) creature takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Hulking Smash

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br> **Prerequisite:** Stop Hitting Each Other and 225 CP of Barbarian talents
When you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with a circumstancial +1d, you can choose to forgo the +1d. If you do so and hit the target, (add one successful die for the purpose of calculating a critical hit.) **or** (treat one die rolled as a 20 to maximize its damage).
