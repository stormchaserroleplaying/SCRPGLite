# Frenzy
For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end, that end being violence. A frenzied barbarian is one of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter a mindless rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

### Battle Frenzy

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage
While raging, your senses become dulled and adrenlaine pushes your body beyond mundane concerns like fatigue. Your martial ferocity greatly increases but you receive 1 level of [exhaustion](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Exhaustion/) when your rage ends. While raging, you gain the following benefits:

* You ignore the effects of [exhaustion](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Exhaustion/) while raging.
* While wielding a single one-handed weapon, your weapon is considered [versatile](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Weapons/Glossary/#versatile) and being wielded in two hands for the sake of damage calculation and countering [disarm](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Disarm/) attempts.
* While wielding a two-handed weapon, the damage bonus from your Strength increases to twice your Strength modifier.
* While dual-wielding, [striking](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) with both weapons is resolved simultaneously using 1 action and attack roll. For example, attacking with two daggers would require 1 weapons attack roll and damage would be 2d4 + Strength Modifier.

### Mindless Rage

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Battle Frenzy and 50 CP of other Barbarian Talents
You can’t be [charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) or [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) while raging. If you are [charmed](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Charmed/) or [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:**Mindless Rage and 125 CP of other Barbarian Talents
You can use an action to [frighten](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature must be able to see or hear you. Make a rage attack roll vs the creature's Wisdom defence. If you hit, the creature is [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use an action to extend the duration of this effect on the [frightened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Frightened/) creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If you miss, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

### Retaliation

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Intimidating Presence and 225 CP of other Barbarian Talents
Once each round, the first time that you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, the creature must make a Strength or Dexterity defence check (creature's choice) vs. your weapon skill. If the creature fails, you hit it with a melee attack.
