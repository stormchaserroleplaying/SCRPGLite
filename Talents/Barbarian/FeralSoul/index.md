# Feral Soul
Feral Soul barbarians draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian. Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters.

### Form of the Beast
#### *Cost:* 15 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* Rage
When you enter your rage, you can transform, revealing the bestial power within you. Until the rage ends, you manifest a natural weapon. You are trained with this weapon, but your proficiency increases with your Martial Feat Die. When your Martial Feat die increases to d8, your proficiency with these natural weapons increases to expert. When your Martial Feat die increases to d10, proficiency increases again to master.

You choose the weapon’s form each time you rage:

**Bite.** Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1dM piercing damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this bite, you regain 1dR stamina if you have less than half your stamina.

**Claws.** Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1dM slashing damage on a hit, and has the finesse and light properties. You can [strike](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Actions/Strike/) using the [dual wield](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Combat/Melee/Dual/) action.

**Tail.** You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1dM piercing damage on a hit and has the reach property. Each round, the first time that a creature that you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee or ranged attack roll, you swipe your tail and add +1d to your defense, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

### Bestial Soul
#### *Cost:* 20 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* Form of the Beast and 50 CP of Barbarian Talents
The feral power within you increases, causing the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast to count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

You can also alter your form to help you adapt to your surroundings. When you finish a short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish your next short or long rest:

**Climbing**
You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make a skill check.

**Jumping**
When you jump, you can make an athletics check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check’s total. You can make this special check only once per turn.

**Swimming**
You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and you can breathe underwater.

### Infectious Fury<br>*Cost:* 30 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* Bestial Soul and 125 CP of Barbarian Talents
When you hit a creature with your natural weapons while you are raging, the beast within you can curse your target with rabid fury. If your attack roll exceeds the target's wisdom defense, they suffer one of the following effects (your choice):
- The target must use one of its actions on its next turn to attack another creature of your choice that you can see.
- The target takes 2dM psychic damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Call the Hunt
#### *Cost:* 50 Character Points<br>*Prerequisite:* Infectious Fury and 225 CP of Barbarian Talents
The beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your rage, you can choose a number of other willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one creature). You gain 1dR temporary stamina for each creature that accepts this feature. Until the rage ends, the chosen creatures can add 1dM to one damage roll each turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your constitution modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
