# Fanatic
Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are fanatics — warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power. A variety of gods inspire their followers to embrace this path. In general, the gods who inspire fanatics are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Fanatical Focus and 125 CP of Barbarian Talents

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Rage Beyond Death

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Zealous Presence and 225 CP of Barbarian Talents
The divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.

While you’re raging, having 0 stamina doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still make [recovery checks](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Stamina/Recovery/#recovery-checks), and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 Stamina. However, if you would die due to failing [recovery checks](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Stamina/Recovery/#recovery-checks), you don’t die until your rage ends and you die then only if you still have 0 stamina.
