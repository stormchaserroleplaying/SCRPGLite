# Barbarian Talent Tree
For some, there is only rage. In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, conflict is all these brutal souls know. Savages, hired muscle, masters of vicious martial techniques. They are not soldiers or professional warriors, they are the battle-possessed. Creatures of slaughter and spirits of war. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of training, preparation, or the rules of warfare; for them, only the moment exists, with the foes that stand before them and the knowledge that the next moment might hold their death. They possess a sixth sense in regard to danger and the endurance to weather all that might entail. These brutal warriors might rise from all walks of life, both civilised and savage, though whole societies embracing such philosophies roam the wild places of the world. Within barbarians storms the primal spirit of battle, and woe to those who face their rage.

### Rage

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You fight with a primal ferocity; you have a number of rage points equal to your Constitution modifier. These rage points can be spent to trigger [rage powers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Barbarian/RagePowers/). You also gain 1 rage point whenever:
* You hit a hostile creature with an attack for the first time that round.
* You are hit by an attack for the first time that round.
* You score a critical hit.
* You or an ally suffers a critical hit.
* You drop below half of your stamina maximum.
* An ally falls unconscious or dies.

Rage points gained in these ways may exceed your rage point maximum. When you finish a short or long rest, your total rage points reset to your Constitution modifier.

As an action on your turn, you can spend a rage point to enter a furious bloodlust. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
* You have advantage on Strength checks.
* When you make a melee weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to your martial feat die.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or sustain them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end your rage at any time (no action required).

Some [rage powers](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Barbarian/RagePowers/) or barbarian talents call for the barbarian to make a rage attack roll. When making a rage attack roll, roll your d20 dice pool and add your Constitution modifier to the result. All barbarians are considered to be trained in rage attacks. This proficiency may be raised to expertise or mastery by spending character points, just as for any other weapon proficiency.

### Natural Resilience

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 5 Character Points
You have innate Damage Reduction equal to your Constitution modifier. This DR does not stack with armour, but when wearing armour you may use the better of your Constitution modifier or the armour's DR.

Additionally, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. Attack rolls for effects that you can see, such as traps and spells, that target your Dexterity defence suffer a -1d penalty. You also gain +1d on Dexterity defence checks against such effects. To gain this benefit, you can’t be [blinded](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Blinded/), [deafened](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Deafened/), or [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/).

### Rimehand

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost: 10 Character Points**<br>**Prerequisite:** 10 CP of Barbarian Talents
When you rage, you gain the following benefits:
* You gain resistance to cold damage.
* Your defences gain +1d vs extreme cold and effects that deal cold damage.
* Your melee attacks deal additional cold damage equal to your Constitution modifier.

### Reckless Attack

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage plus 10 CP of Barbarian talents
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you +1d to weapon attack rolls during this turn, but attack rolls against you gain +1d until your next turn.

### Fast Movement

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 20 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Reckless Attack plus 30 CP of Barbarian Talents
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armour.

### Feral Instinct

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 15 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Natural Resilience plus 50 CP of Barbarian Talents
Your instincts are so honed that you have +1d on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t [incapacitated](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Incapacitated/), you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Instinctive Pounce

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 10 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Fast Movement plus 50 CP of Barbarian Talents
As part of the action you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

### Brutal Critical

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 30 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Instinctive Pounce plus 60 CP of Barbarian Talents
You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

### Relentless Rage

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 35 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Rage and Feral Instinct plus 90 CP of Barbarian Talents
Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution defence check at the start of your next turn. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this talent after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Brutal Critical II

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 50 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Brutal Critical and Relentless Rage plus 125 CP of Barbarian Talents
You can now roll two additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

### Persistent Rage

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 65 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Relentless Rage plus 175 CP of Barbarian Talents
Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall [unconscious](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Conditions/Unconscious/) or if you choose to end it.

### Brutal Critical III

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Brutal Critical II and Persistent Rage plus 240 CP of Barbarian Talents
You can now roll three additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

### Indomitable Might

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 80 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Brutal Critical III plus 320 CP of Barbarian Talents
If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion

<div style="margin-top:-10px;"></div>

#### **Cost:** 100 Character Points<br>**Prerequisite:** Indomitable Might plus 400 CP of Barbarian Talents
You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.
