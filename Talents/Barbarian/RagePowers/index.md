# Rage Powers
Any character with the [Rage](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Talents/Barbarian/#rage) talent and who also meets a power's prerequisites can acquire a rage power. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers. For example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).

The second target must be close enough to reach in melee. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks and the second attack does not suffer from the [multiple attack penalty](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Specific/Attack/#multiple-attack-penalty).
