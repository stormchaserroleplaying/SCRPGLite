# Downtime Activities
Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

## Crafting
You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every hour of downtime you spend crafting using a tool with which you are proficient, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 1 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value.

If you have expertise in the tool in question, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 2 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 1 gp worth of effort for every hour spent helping to craft the item (2 gp with expertise).

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 gp per week, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Expenses/LifestyleExpenses/) for more information on lifestyle expenses).

### Mundane Items
Mundane items require often require less time to craft than enchanted items. Determine the craft DC and time required to craft a mundane item using the Item Complexity, Crafting Times and DCs table.

#### Item Complexity
The complexity categories listed in the table above are defined as follows. Keep in mind that the key to item complexity isn't to rely on an exhaustive list of what items belong to which categories. Instead, these rules provide basic category descriptions and a few examples of sorts of items one might expect to fit each category.
* **Very Simple:** These items are more or less all one piece or one material of simple shape with no moving parts. **Examples:** crowbar, quarterstaff.
* **Simple:** A simple item is largely made of one material, but it requires a more specialized shape.<br>**Examples:** many simple weapons, backpack, most common articles of clothing, simple traps such as pits.
* **Moderate:** Moderate complexity items are characterized by diverse materials or different parts that must be integrated into a whole.<br>**Examples:** Most martial and exotic weapons, bows, shields, locks, simple traps using simple mechanical triggers, acid.
* **Complex:** Complex items have diverse materials, moving parts, different parts, and/or decorative bits.<br>**Examples:** Most types of armour, composite bows, crossbows, most vehicles (excluding large ocean-going vessels), alchemist’s fire, smokesticks, tingertwigs.
* **Very Complex:** These are the most complicated items. They require diverse materials, moving parts, different parts, decorated bits, and/or multiple functions or uses.<br>**Examples:** ocean-going vessels, unusual armours (such as barding), antitoxins, tanglefoot bags, sunrods, thunderstones.

| Item Complexity | Crafting Time | Craft DC |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|:--------:|
| Very simple | 4 hours | 10 |
| Simple | 8 hours | 12 |
| Moderate | 16 hours | 14 |
| Complex | 32 hours | 18 |
| Very complex | 64 hours | 26 |

#### Crafting Masterwork Items
A masterwork item has a 50% increase in crafting time and an item-type-dependent increase in cost (1000 gp for a weapon, 1500 gp for a suit of armour or a shield, or 50 gp for masterwork tools). Furthermore, any masterwork item has its craft DC increased by 4.

#### Working with Special Materials
A craftsman working with an unusual material (such as adamantine) faces a 50% increase in crafting time, which stacks with the 50% increase in crafting time associated with masterwork items, when applicable. Also, unusual materials are harder to work with and increase the item's DC:

| Material | DC Modifier |
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| Adamantine | +6 |
| Darkwood | +2 |
| Dragonhide | +4 |
| Cold iron | +2 |
| Mithril | +4 |
| Alchemical silver | +2 |

#### Using Tools (or Not…)
All crafts require tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check suffers disadvantage. Masterwork tools provide advantage to the check.

#### Failing a Check
What happens if the check fails? Well, that depends on how badly it failed. When confronted with a failed check, there are up to three possible bad effects:
1. If the check fails, the item is not completed. Invest the full crafting time and try again.
2. If the check fails by 5 or more, half of the raw materials are ruined. Pay half the raw materials cost to replace the ruined materials.
3. If the check fails by 10 or more and you are using alchemist's supplies, your laboratory explodes. Pay to replace it as well as the ruined raw materials (as number 2 above). Also make a DC 10 Dexterity defence check to avoid 1d6 points of fire damage.

#### Exceptional Check Results
For every 5 points by which the check exceed the item’s DC, the crafting time is halved. A crafting time can be halved in this way more than twice.

## Practicing a Profession
You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 gp per week (see [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Expenses/LifestyleExpenses/) for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.

If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

## Recuperating
You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution defence check. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:
* End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
* For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on defence checks against one disease or poison currently affecting you.

## Researching
The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed [here](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/Equipment/Expenses/LifestyleExpenses/)).

### Spell Research
*Adapted from [Giffyglyph's Class Compendium](https://giffyglyph.com/classcompendium/ "Giffyglyph's Class Compendium")*

Characters who store spells in a spell book are able to learn new spells through careful study, research, and magical experimentation. By spending downtime experimenting, you can expand your spellbook with new arcane knowledge.

To perform arcane research, there are four basic steps:

1. **Define your Research Topic:** Choose a spell from your spell list that you want to learn. The spell must be of a level that you have spell slots for.

2. **Setup your Laboratory:** Assemble your research equipment and laboratory. At a bare minimum, you must have access to your spellbook, inks, magical components and some peace. Favourable conditions, such as help from an assistant, high quality equipment, or detailed reference material can grant advantage on your research check.

3. **Make a Research Check:** Once you have everything set up, you can begin your research. After each period of, study make an Intelligence (Arcana) check of DC 10 + double the spell level of your target spell. Compare your margin of success relative to the Spell Research DC with the Spell Research Results table.

4. **Complete your Research:** Once you have accumulated a total of 40 hours per spell level of the spell being researched, you may pay the spend the scribing cost of the spell in gp to add it to your spellbook.

###### Spell Research Results

| Margin of Success | Outcome |
|:-----------------:|:--------|
| −10 or less |**Critical Failure:** Your research hits a dead end. The full amount of time invested in this research check is subtracted from the progress that you have made.
| −5 to −9 |**Exceptional Failure:** Your research hits a dead end. Half the time invested in this research check is subtracted from the progress that you have made.
| −1 to −4 |**Failure:** Your research falters, making no progress towards completion.
| +0 to +4 | **Success:** Your research is adequate, advancing towards completion as per the amount of time invested in researching.
| +5 to +9 | **Exceptional Success:** Your research has a breakthrough, advancing towards completion as per the amount of time invested in researching. Additionally, you gain a research credit.
| +10 or more |**Critical Success:** Your research is excellent, advancing twice as much towards completion as the time invested in researching.

If you roll a 1 on your research check, your research causes an immediate, automatic complication. If you roll a natural 20 on your research check, increase your margin of success by one step. Additionally, you can increase your margin of success by one step, by making a complication check.

#### Complications

When a complication occurs, make a roll on the Spell Research Complications table:

###### Spell Research Complications

| d100 | Complication |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 1-20 |**Destruction:** There was a small fire and you accidentally singed your spellbook. Lose one random spell from your spellbook (or the spellbook itself if you have no spells to lose).
| 21-50	|**Noticed:** Your experiments have drawn unwanted attention from someone or something who will make your life more difficult, such as:<br>    1. A demon.<br> 2. A higher power.<br>3. A noble of the land.<br>4. A thief.<br>5. A mage hunter.<br>6. A wild monster.<br>7. A rival wizard.<br>8. A zealous cleric.<br>9. A furious druid.<br>10. An angry mob.
| 51-80 |**Backfire:** An experiment backfired and you now suffer from a magical affliction. For example:<br>1. You have turned yourself into a frog.<br>2. Your skin turns a random color.<br>3. All of your hair falls out.<br>4. Your teeth turn sharp and black.<br>5. Your head swells to twice its normal size.<br>6. You periodically vomit up living slugs.<br>7. Your hands turn things red for 1 hour.<br>8. Your body grows a thick layer of animal fur.<br>9. Your hands are turned into crab-like pincers.<br>10. Words you speak are reversed.
| 81-100 |**Accident:** Your research has caused an accident. You owe 1d10 x 10 gp per spell level to cover the damages.

#### Research Credits
During your experiments and adventures, you may find research notes made by other spellcasters. These research credits can help you during your studies.

When you make a research check, you can spend one research credit to add +1d4 to the result. For every additional research credit you spend, you increase the size of the die by one step (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12) to a maximum of 1d12.

## Training
Given enough time, money, and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language, pick up proficiency with a tool, gain proficiency or even expertise in a skill, or possibly even earn a feat.

###### Training Costs

| Training | Duration | Total Cost |
|:--------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| Proficiency, Language, Subskill | 500 h | 250 gp | 
| Expertise | 1000 h | 500 gp |
| Mastery, Feat | 8,500 h | 4,250 gp |

Learning a new tool, skill, or weapon proficiency, or a language or subskill takes 500 hours. Sufficient learning resources to study alone should cost a total of approximately 250 gp.

Developing expertise with a tool, skill, or weapon takes 1000 hours. Sufficient learning resources to study alone should cost a total of approximately 500 gp.

Attaining mastery with a tool, skill, or weapon, or learning a feat takes 8,500 hours. Sufficient learning resources to study alone should cost a total of approximately 4,250 gp.

### Resources
Training requires you to first find a learning resource (such as a book) or a teacher who is capable of teaching you and willing to do so.

Books and other, similar learning resources must be bought in advance, but have the advantage of allowing a character to teach themselves in their free time. It takes a number of books with a value equal to the total cost of training to provide sufficient material with which to complete the training.

Personal instruction with a teacher who is able to assess the character individually and determine what would be the next step for them to develop and improve is significantly more effective. Every hour spent learning with a teacher adds two hours to the amount of time spent training. Training with a teacher typically costs 5 sp per hour.

It then takes a varying amount of time and money, depending on what you are learning.

### Resolution
At the end of each day, a character makes an ability check depending on their training:

* Training in a language calls for an Intelligence check.
* Training in a subskill calls for an ability check with that subskill's governing skill.
* Training proficiency in a tool calls for an ability check appropriate to that tool, as determined by the GM.
* Training proficiency in a skill calls for an ability check with that skill’s governing ability score.
* Training proficiency in a weapon calls for an attack roll with strength, or with dexterity for finesse weapons.
* Training expertise or mastery in a tool calls for an ability check with that tool.
* Training expertise or mastery in a skill calls for an ability check with that skill.
* Training expertise or mastery in a weapon calls for an attack roll with that weapon.
* Training in a feat calls for an ability check appropriate to that feat, as determined by the GM.

If you are proficient in the corresponding defence, you make the roll with proficiency.

Afterwards, consult the Training Results table. A natural 1 results in no progress for that day and a complication. A character that rolls a natural 20 may immediately roll again for that day, adding the result to the progress from the first roll.

###### Training Results

| Ability Check DC | Result |
|:----------------:|:------:|
| 9 or less | Your training falters, advancing only only half as much towards completion as the time invested in training. |
| 10-19 | Your training is adequate, advancing towards completion as per the amount of time invested in training. |
| 20-29 | Your training is exceptional, advancing twice as much towards completion as the time invested in training. |
| 30 or more | Your training is masterful, advancing three times as much towards completion as the time invested in training. |

### Complications
Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. For every 200 hours spent in training, or for each failure during resolution, a character has a 10% chance of a complication. Examples of which are on the table below:

| d6 | Complication |
|:--:|:------------:|
| 1	| You earn the ire of another of the teacher’s students. |
| 2	| Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others. |
| 3	| Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans. |
| 4	| Your teacher is a wanted criminal. |
| 5	| Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster. |
| 6	| Your teacher asks for help dealing with a threat. |
