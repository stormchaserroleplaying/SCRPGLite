# Full Rest
A full rest is a period of downtime, at least 24 hours long, during which a character sleeps at least 8 hours and otherwise performs only light activity, such as reading, talking, or eating.

A full rest cannot be attempted while in the wilderness, sleeping on dirt or stone, or wearing armour. You must be in a safe location where you do not feel the need to keep watch or constantly be on guard. You must also consume food and drink. If these conditions are met you lose up to 2 levels of exhaustion. At the end of a full rest, you recover all lost stamina.

A full rest also counts towards recovering from headaches, internal injuries, neuralgia, or systemic damage, as described in under [Injuries](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/General/Damage/Injuries/).
