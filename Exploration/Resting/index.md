# Resting
Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest. Time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take breathers and short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it. Full and extended rests are required for longer periods of recuperation.

| Type | Duration | Benefits |
|-----:|:--------:|:---------|
| Breather | 10 Minutes | Once per short rest, roll 1dR + your Constitution modifier to recover stamina, or 1dP + your spellcasting attribute modifer to recover mana. |
| Short Rest | 1 Hour | Once per long rest, roll 2dR + your Constitution modifier to recover stamina, or 2dP + your spellcasting attribute modifer to recover mana. Alternatively, you may one of each die, plus the appropriate modifier, to recover a little of both. If you have one and only one level of exhaustion, recover from it. |
| Long Rest | 8 Hours | Regain all lost stamina and mana. Reduce exhaustion by one level. |
| Full Rest | 1 Day | Reduce exhaustion by two levels. Counts towards injury recovery. |
| Extended Rest | 1 Week | Recharge stronghold abilities and lose the wounded condition. |
