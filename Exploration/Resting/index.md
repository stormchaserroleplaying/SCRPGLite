# Resting
Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest. Time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.

Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take breathers and short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it. Full and extended rests are required for longer periods of recuperation.
